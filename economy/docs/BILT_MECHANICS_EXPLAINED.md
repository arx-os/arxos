# BILT Token Mechanics Explained

## 🏗️ **How BILT Actually Works**

### **1. Token Creation (Minting)**

**Process:**
1. **Engineer uploads** building objects (HVAC systems, lighting, etc.) to Arxos
2. **AI validation** using ArxLogic checks if the design is valid
3. **Secondary user verification** - another user must verify the object is useful
4. **BILT tokens minted** to the contributor's wallet
5. **Unlimited supply** - tokens created based on number of objects, not fixed cap

**Example:**
```
Sarah uploads HVAC system design → AI validates → John verifies → Sarah gets 100 BILT
```

### **2. Dividend Distribution**

**Key Point:** All BILT holders receive equal dividends, regardless of how they got their tokens.

**Process:**
1. **Platform generates revenue** from data sales and service transactions
2. **Revenue goes to dividend pool** (not tied to specific objects)
3. **Equal distribution** to all BILT holders based on their token amount
4. **No distinction** between contributor-minted tokens and secondary market tokens

**Example:**
```
Platform revenue: $10,000
Total BILT supply: 100,000 tokens
Dividend per token: $0.10
Sarah (100 BILT) gets: $10
John (50 BILT) gets: $5
Mike (bought 200 BILT on exchange) gets: $20
```

### **3. Verification System**

**Two-Step Verification:**
1. **AI Verification:** ArxLogic validates the object makes engineering sense
2. **Secondary User Verification:** Another user must verify the object is useful

**No Tiers:** All contributions handled equally - no Bronze/Silver/Gold system

### **4. Token Economics**

**Supply:** Unlimited based on objects created
**Fungibility:** All tokens are equal and freely tradeable
**Dividends:** Equal rights for all holders regardless of source
**No Simulation Focus:** Arxos is not focused on simulation services

### **5. Real-World Example**

**Scenario:**
- Engineer Alice uploads building HVAC design
- AI validates it's code-compliant
- Engineer Bob verifies it's useful for his projects
- Alice receives 150 BILT tokens
- Alice sells 50 BILT to Charlie on an exchange
- Platform generates $5,000 in revenue
- All three get dividends: Alice (100 BILT) = $5, Bob (0 BILT) = $0, Charlie (50 BILT) = $2.50

### **6. Key Differences from Previous Documentation**

| Previous | Correct |
|----------|---------|
| Object-specific dividends | Equal dividends for all holders |
| Fixed supply cap | Unlimited supply based on objects |
| Peer review for high-value | Secondary verification for all |
| Contributor tiers | Equal treatment for all |
| Simulation services focus | Data sales and service transactions |

### **7. Benefits of This Model**

**For Contributors:**
- Immediate reward for quality work
- Ongoing dividends from platform success
- No discrimination based on contribution size

**For Token Holders:**
- Equal dividend rights regardless of source
- Free market trading
- Simple tax treatment

**For Platform:**
- Quality control through AI + verification
- Sustainable economics based on real usage
- Clear regulatory compliance

### **8. Transparency and Visibility (ArxScope)**

**Public Dashboard:**
- Real-time metrics at `dashboard.arxos.xyz`
- Live BILT supply, dividend pool, and market data
- Anonymous building performance rankings
- Contributor leaderboards (opt-in public names)
- Mint activity feed with object types and locations

**Privacy Protection:**
- Buyer identities and contracts remain confidential
- Hash-based obfuscation of sensitive data
- Aggregate revenue statistics only
- On-chain truth for all transactions

### **9. Regulatory Compliance**

**Worker Classification:**
- Contributors are workers earning for labor
- BILT holders are currency participants
- Dividends are platform revenue sharing
- No speculative promises

**Tax Treatment:**
- Contributors: Report BILT as work income
- Holders: Report dividends as income
- No capital gains treatment for work-minted tokens

This model creates a **fair and sustainable ecosystem** where quality work is rewarded with both immediate tokens and ongoing platform revenue sharing, while maintaining equal rights for all token holders and complete transparency through ArxScope.

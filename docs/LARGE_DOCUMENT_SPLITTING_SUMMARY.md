## 🎯 **Splitting Rationale**

### **Why This Document Was Split**
1. **Excessive Size**: 23KB and 736 lines exceeded recommended document size limits
2. **Multiple Topics**: Covered 6 distinct major systems that deserved separate documentation
3. **Maintenance Difficulty**: Large documents are harder to maintain and update
4. **Navigation Issues**: Users had difficulty finding specific information
5. **Development Focus**: Each system needed dedicated documentation for development teams

### **Benefits of Splitting**
- **📖 Focused Documentation**: Each document focuses on a specific system
- **🔍 Better Navigation**: Easier to find specific information
- **📝 Easier Maintenance**: Smaller, focused documents are easier to update
- **👥 Team Collaboration**: Different teams can work on different documents
- **📊 Clear Status**: Each system has its own development status and roadmap

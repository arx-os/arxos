# How to read rustdoc output
Rustdoc's HTML output includes a friendly and useful navigation interface which makes it easier for users to navigate and understand your code. This chapter covers the major features of that interface, and is a great starting point for documentation authors and users alike.

Structure

The rustdoc output is divided into three sections. Along the left side of each page is a quick navigation bar, which shows contextual information about the current entry. The rest of the page is taken up by the search interface at the top and the documentation for the current item below that.

The Item Documentation

The majority of the screen is taken up with the documentation text for the item currently being viewed. At the top is some at-a-glance info and controls:

the type and name of the item, such as "Struct std::time::Duration",
a button to copy the item's path to the clipboard, which is a clipboard item
a button to collapse or expand the top-level documentation for that item ([+] or [-]),
a link to the source code ([src]), if configured, and present (the source may not be available if the documentation was created with cargo doc --no-deps),
and the version in which the item became stable, if it's a stable item in the standard library.
Below this is the main documentation for the item, including a definition or function signature if appropriate, followed by a list of fields or variants for Rust types. Finally, the page lists associated functions and trait implementations, including automatic and blanket implementations that rustdoc knows about.

Sections

Aliased Type

A type alias is expanded at compile time to its aliased type. That may involve substituting some or all of the type parameters in the target type with types provided by the type alias definition. The Aliased Type section shows the result of this expansion, including the types of public fields or variants, which may depend on those substitutions.

Navigation

Subheadings, variants, fields, and many other things in this documentation are anchors and can be clicked on and deep-linked to, which is a great way to communicate exactly what you're talking about. The typographical character "§" appears next to lines with anchors on them when hovered or given keyboard focus.

The Navigation Bar

For example, when looking at documentation for the crate root, it shows all the crates documented in the documentation bundle, and quick links to the modules, structs, traits, functions, and macros available from the current crate. At the top, it displays a configurable logo alongside the current crate's name and version, or the current item whose documentation is being displayed.

The Theme Picker and Search Interface

When viewing rustdoc's output in a browser with JavaScript enabled, a dynamic interface appears at the top of the page composed of the search interface, help screen, and options.

Paths are supported as well, you can look for Vec::new or Option::Some or even module::module_child::another_child::struct::field. Whitespace characters are considered the same as ::, so if you write Vec new, it will be considered the same as Vec::new.

Shortcuts

Pressing S while focused elsewhere on the page will move focus to the search bar, and pressing ? shows the help screen, which includes all these shortcuts and more.

When the search results are focused, the left and right arrows move between tabs and the up and down arrows move among the results. Pressing the enter or return key opens the highlighted result.

When looking at the documentation for an item, the plus and minus keys expand and collapse all sections in the document.

## In-doc settings

Rustdoc's HTML output includes a settings menu, and this chapter describes what each setting in this menu does.

It can be accessed by clicking on the gear button () in the upper right.

Changing displayed theme

It is possible to change the theme. If you pick the "system preference", you will be able to see two new sub-menus: "Preferred light theme" and "Preferred dark theme". It means that if your system preference is set to "light", then rustdoc will use the theme you selected in "Preferred light theme".

Auto-hide item contents for large items

If the type definition contains more than 12 items, and this setting is enabled, it'll collapse them by default. You can see them by clicking on the [+] button to expand them.

A good example of this setting in use can be seen in the Iterator doc page:

Collapsed long item

Auto-hide item methods' documentation

If enabled, this setting will collapse all trait implementations blocks. It is convenient if you just want an overview of all the methods available. You can still see a method's documentation by expanding it.

Auto-hide trait implementation documentation

If enabled, this setting will collapse all trait implementations blocks (you can see them in the "Trait Implementations" section). It is convenient if you just want an overview of all the trait implemented on a type. You can still see a trait implementation's associated items by expanding it.

Example:

Collapsed trait implementations

Directly go to item in search if there is only one result

If this setting is enabled, you will directly be taken to the result page if your search only returned one element. Useful if you know exactly what you're looking for and want to be taken there directly and not waste time selecting the only search result.

Show line numbers on code examples

If enabled, this setting will add line numbers to the code examples in the documentation. It provides a visual aide for the code reading.

Disable keyboard shortcuts

If this setting is enabled, the keyboard shortcuts will be disabled. It's useful in case some of these shortcuts are already used by a web extension you're using.

To see the full list of the rustdoc keyboard shortcuts, you can open the help menu (the button with the question mark on the left of the setting menu button).

## Search

Typing in the search bar instantly searches the available documentation, matching either the name and path of an item, or a function's approximate type signature.

Search By Name

To search by the name of an item (items include modules, types, traits, functions, and macros), write its name or path. As a special case, the parts of a path that normally get divided by :: double colons can instead be separated by spaces. For example:

vec new and vec::new both show the function std::vec::Vec::new as a result.
vec, vec vec, std::vec, and std::vec::Vec all include the struct std::vec::Vec itself in the results (and all but the last one also include the module in the results).
As a quick way to trim down the list of results, there's a drop-down selector below the search input, labeled "Results in [std]". Clicking it can change which crate is being searched.

Rustdoc uses a fuzzy matching function that can tolerate typos for this, though it's based on the length of the name that's typed in, so a good example of how this works would be HahsMap. To avoid this, wrap the item in quotes, searching for "HahsMap" (in this example, no results will be returned).

Tabs in the Search By Name interface

In fact, using HahsMap again as the example, it tells you that you're using "In Names" by default, but also lists two other tabs below the crate drop-down: "In Parameters" and "In Return Types".

These two tabs are lists of functions, defined on the closest matching type to the search (for HahsMap, it loudly auto-corrects to hashmap). This auto-correct only kicks in if nothing is found that matches the literal.

These tabs are not just methods. For example, searching the alloc crate for Layout also lists functions that accept layouts even though they're methods on the allocator or free functions.

Searching By Type Signature

If you know more specifically what the function you want to look at does, or you want to know how to get from one type to another, Rustdoc can search by more than one type at once in the parameters and return value. Multiple parameters are separated by , commas, and the return value is written with after a -> arrow.

Before describing the syntax in more detail, here's a few sample searches of the standard library and functions that are included in the results list:

Query	Results
usize -> vec	slice::repeat and Vec::with_capacity
vec, vec -> bool	Vec::eq
option<T>, fnonce -> option<U>	Option::map and Option::and_then
option<T>, (fnonce (T) -> bool) -> option<T>	Option::filter
option<T>, (T -> bool) -> option<T>	Option::filter
option -> default	Option::unwrap_or_default
stdout, [u8]	Stdout::write
any -> !	panic::panic_any
vec::intoiter<T> -> [T]	IntoIter::as_slice and IntoIter::next_chunk
iterator<T>, fnmut -> T	Iterator::reduce and Iterator::find
Non-functions in type-based search

Certain items that are not functions are treated as though they were a semantically equivalent function.

For example, struct fields are treated as though they were getter methods. This means that a search for CpuidResult -> u32 will show the CpuidResult::eax field in the results.

Additionally, const and static items are treated as nullary functions, so -> u32 will match u32::MAX.

How type-based search works

In a complex type-based search, Rustdoc always treats every item's name as literal. If a name is used and nothing in the docs matches the individual item, such as a typo-ed uize -> vec search, the item uize is treated as a generic type parameter (resulting in vec::from and other generic vec constructors).

After deciding which items are type parameters and which are actual types, it then searches by matching up the function parameters (written before the ->) and the return types (written after the ->). Type matching is order-agnostic, and allows items to be left out of the query, but items that are present in the query must be present in the function for it to match. The self parameter is treated the same as any other parameter, and Self is resolved to the underlying type's name.

Function signature searches can query generics, wrapped in angle brackets, and traits will be normalized like types in the search engine if no type parameters match them. For example, a function with the signature fn my_function<I: Iterator<Item=u32>>(input: I) -> usize can be matched with the following queries:

Iterator<Item=u32> -> usize
Iterator<u32> -> usize (you can leave out the Item= part)
Iterator -> usize (you can leave out iterator's generic entirely)
T -> usize (you can match with a generic parameter)
Each of the above queries is progressively looser, except the last one would not match dyn Iterator, since that's not a type parameter.

If a bound has multiple associated types, specifying the name allows you to pick which one gets matched. If no name is specified, then the query will match of any of them. For example,

pub trait MyTrait {
    type First;
    type Second;
}

/// This function can be found using the following search queries:
///
///     MyTrait<First=u8, Second=u32> -> bool
///     MyTrait<Second=u32> -> bool
///
/// The following queries, however, will *not* match it:
///
///     MyTrait<First=u32> -> bool
///     MyTrait<u32, u32> -> bool
///     MyTrait<u32, First=u8> -> bool
///     MyTrait<u32, u8> -> bool
pub fn my_fn(x: impl MyTrait<First=u8, Second=u32>) -> bool { true }
Function parameters are order-agnostic, but sensitive to nesting and number of matches. For example, a function with the signature fn read_all(&mut self: impl Read) -> Result<Vec<u8>, Error> will match these queries:

&mut Read -> Result<Vec<u8>, Error>
Read -> Result<Vec<u8>, Error>
Read -> Result<Vec<u8>>
Read -> Vec<u8>
But it does not match Result<Vec, u8> or Result<u8<Vec>>, because those are nested incorrectly, and it does not match Result<Error, Vec<u8>> or Result<Error>, because those are in the wrong order. It also does not match Read -> u8, because only certain generic wrapper types can be left out, and Vec isn't one of them.

To search for a function that accepts a function as a parameter, like Iterator::all, wrap the nested signature in parenthesis, as in Iterator<T>, (T -> bool) -> bool. You can also search for a specific closure trait, such as Iterator<T>, (FnMut(T) -> bool) -> bool, but you need to know which one you want.

Primitives with Special Syntax

Shorthand	Explicit names
&	primitive:reference
&T	primitive:reference<T>
&mut	primitive:reference<keyword:mut>
&mut T	primitive:reference<keyword:mut, T>
[]	primitive:slice and/or primitive:array
[T]	primitive:slice<T> and/or primitive:array<T>
()	primitive:unit and/or primitive:tuple
(T)	T
(T,)	primitive:tuple<T>
!	primitive:never
(T, U -> V, W)	fn(T, U) -> (V, W), Fn, FnMut, and FnOnce
When searching for [], Rustdoc will return search results with either slices or arrays. If you know which one you want, you can force it to return results for primitive:slice or primitive:array using the explicit name syntax. Empty square brackets, [], will match any slice or array regardless of what it contains, or an item type can be provided, such as [u8] or [T], to explicitly find functions that operate on byte slices or generic slices, respectively.

A single type expression wrapped in parens is the same as that type expression, since parens act as the grouping operator. If they're empty, though, they will match both unit and tuple, and if there's more than one type (or a trailing or leading comma) it is the same as primitive:tuple<...>.

However, since items can be left out of the query, (T) will still return results for types that match tuples, even though it also matches the type on its own. That is, (u32) matches (u32,) for the exact same reason that it also matches Result<u32, Error>.

The -> operator has lower precedence than comma. If it's not wrapped in brackets, it delimits the return value for the function being searched for. To search for functions that take functions as parameters, use parenthesis.

Limitations and quirks of type-based search

Type-based search is still a buggy, experimental, work-in-progress feature. Most of these limitations should be addressed in future version of Rustdoc.

There's no way to write trait constraints on generic parameters. You can name traits directly, and if there's a type parameter with that bound, it'll match, but option<T> -> T where T: Default cannot be precisely searched for (use option<Default> -> Default).

Supertraits, type aliases, and Deref are all ignored. Search mostly operates on type signatures as written, and not as they are represented within the compiler.

Type parameters match type parameters, such that Option<A> matches Option<T>, but never match concrete types in function signatures. A trait named as if it were a type, such as Option<Read>, will match a type parameter constrained by that trait, such as Option<T> where T: Read, as well as matching dyn Trait and impl Trait.

impl Trait in argument position is treated exactly like a type parameter, but in return position it will not match type parameters.

Any type named in a complex type-based search will be assumed to be a type parameter if nothing matching the name exactly is found. If you want to force a type parameter, write generic:T and it will be used as a type parameter even if a matching name is found. If you know that you don't want a type parameter, you can force it to match something else by giving it a different prefix like struct:T.

Searching for lifetimes is not supported.

It's impossible to search based on the length of an array.

Item filtering

Names in the search interface can be prefixed with an item type followed by a colon (such as mod:) to restrict the results to just that kind of item. Also, searching for println! will search for a macro named println, just like searching for macro:println does. The complete list of available filters is given under the ? Help area, and in the detailed syntax below.

Item filters can be used in both name-based and type signature-based searches.

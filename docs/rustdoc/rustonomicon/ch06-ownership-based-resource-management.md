# Ownership Based Resource Management
OBRM (AKA RAII: Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) is something you'll interact with a lot in Rust. Especially if you use the standard library.

Roughly speaking the pattern is as follows: to acquire a resource, you create an object that manages it. To release the resource, you simply destroy the object, and it cleans up the resource for you. The most common "resource" this pattern manages is simply memory. Box, Rc, and basically everything in std::collections is a convenience to enable correctly managing memory. This is particularly important in Rust because we have no pervasive GC to rely on for memory management. Which is the point, really: Rust is about control. However we are not limited to just memory. Pretty much every other system resource like a thread, file, or socket is exposed through this kind of API.

## Constructors

There is exactly one way to create an instance of a user-defined type: name it, and initialize all its fields at once:

struct Foo {
    a: u8,
    b: u32,
    c: bool,
}

enum Bar {
    X(u32),
    Y(bool),
}

struct Unit;

let foo = Foo { a: 0, b: 1, c: false };
let bar = Bar::X(0);
let empty = Unit;
That's it. Every other way you make an instance of a type is just calling a totally vanilla function that does some stuff and eventually bottoms out to The One True Constructor.

Unlike C++, Rust does not come with a slew of built-in kinds of constructor. There are no Copy, Default, Assignment, Move, or whatever constructors. The reasons for this are varied, but it largely boils down to Rust's philosophy of being explicit.

Move constructors are meaningless in Rust because we don't enable types to "care" about their location in memory. Every type must be ready for it to be blindly memcopied to somewhere else in memory. This means pure on-the-stack-but- still-movable intrusive linked lists are simply not happening in Rust (safely).

Assignment and copy constructors similarly don't exist because move semantics are the only semantics in Rust. At most x = y just moves the bits of y into the x variable. Rust does provide two facilities for providing C++'s copy- oriented semantics: Copy and Clone. Clone is our moral equivalent of a copy constructor, but it's never implicitly invoked. You have to explicitly call clone on an element you want to be cloned. Copy is a special case of Clone where the implementation is just "copy the bits". Copy types are implicitly cloned whenever they're moved, but because of the definition of Copy this just means not treating the old copy as uninitialized -- a no-op.

While Rust provides a Default trait for specifying the moral equivalent of a default constructor, it's incredibly rare for this trait to be used. This is because variables aren't implicitly initialized. Default is basically only useful for generic programming. In concrete contexts, a type will provide a static new method for any kind of "default" constructor. This has no relation to new in other languages and has no special meaning. It's just a naming convention.

TODO: talk about "placement new"?

## Destructors

What the language does provide is full-blown automatic destructors through the Drop trait, which provides the following method:

fn drop(&mut self);
This method gives the type time to somehow finish what it was doing.

After drop is run, Rust will recursively try to drop all of the fields of self.

This is a convenience feature so that you don't have to write "destructor boilerplate" to drop children. If a struct has no special logic for being dropped other than dropping its children, then it means Drop doesn't need to be implemented at all!

There is no stable way to prevent this behavior in Rust 1.0.

Note that taking &mut self means that even if you could suppress recursive Drop, Rust will prevent you from e.g. moving fields out of self. For most types, this is totally fine.

For instance, a custom implementation of Box might write Drop like this:

#![feature(ptr_internals, allocator_api)]

use std::alloc::{Allocator, Global, GlobalAlloc, Layout};
use std::mem;
use std::ptr::{drop_in_place, NonNull, Unique};

struct Box<T>{ ptr: Unique<T> }

impl<T> Drop for Box<T> {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        unsafe {
            drop_in_place(self.ptr.as_ptr());
            let c: NonNull<T> = self.ptr.into();
            Global.deallocate(c.cast(), Layout::new::<T>())
        }
    }
}
and this works fine because when Rust goes to drop the ptr field it just sees a Unique that has no actual Drop implementation. Similarly nothing can use-after-free the ptr because when drop exits, it becomes inaccessible.

However this wouldn't work:

#![feature(allocator_api, ptr_internals)]

use std::alloc::{Allocator, Global, GlobalAlloc, Layout};
use std::ptr::{drop_in_place, Unique, NonNull};
use std::mem;

struct Box<T>{ ptr: Unique<T> }

impl<T> Drop for Box<T> {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        unsafe {
            drop_in_place(self.ptr.as_ptr());
            let c: NonNull<T> = self.ptr.into();
            Global.deallocate(c.cast(), Layout::new::<T>());
        }
    }
}

struct SuperBox<T> { my_box: Box<T> }

impl<T> Drop for SuperBox<T> {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        unsafe {
            // Hyper-optimized: deallocate the box's contents for it
            // without `drop`ing the contents
            let c: NonNull<T> = self.my_box.ptr.into();
            Global.deallocate(c.cast::<u8>(), Layout::new::<T>());
        }
    }
}
After we deallocate the box's ptr in SuperBox's destructor, Rust will happily proceed to tell the box to Drop itself and everything will blow up with use-after-frees and double-frees.

Note that the recursive drop behavior applies to all structs and enums regardless of whether they implement Drop. Therefore something like

struct Boxy<T> {
    data1: Box<T>,
    data2: Box<T>,
    info: u32,
}
will have the destructors of its data1 and data2 fields called whenever it "would" be dropped, even though it itself doesn't implement Drop. We say that such a type needs Drop, even though it is not itself Drop.

Similarly,

enum Link {
    Next(Box<Link>),
    None,
}
will have its inner Box field dropped if and only if an instance stores the Next variant.

In general this works really nicely because you don't need to worry about adding/removing drops when you refactor your data layout. Still there's certainly many valid use cases for needing to do trickier things with destructors.

The classic safe solution to overriding recursive drop and allowing moving out of Self during drop is to use an Option:

#![feature(allocator_api, ptr_internals)]

use std::alloc::{Allocator, GlobalAlloc, Global, Layout};
use std::ptr::{drop_in_place, Unique, NonNull};
use std::mem;

struct Box<T>{ ptr: Unique<T> }

impl<T> Drop for Box<T> {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        unsafe {
            drop_in_place(self.ptr.as_ptr());
            let c: NonNull<T> = self.ptr.into();
            Global.deallocate(c.cast(), Layout::new::<T>());
        }
    }
}

struct SuperBox<T> { my_box: Option<Box<T>> }

impl<T> Drop for SuperBox<T> {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        unsafe {
            // Hyper-optimized: deallocate the box's contents for it
            // without `drop`ing the contents. Need to set the `box`
            // field as `None` to prevent Rust from trying to Drop it.
            let my_box = self.my_box.take().unwrap();
            let c: NonNull<T> = my_box.ptr.into();
            Global.deallocate(c.cast(), Layout::new::<T>());
            mem::forget(my_box);
        }
    }
}
However this has fairly odd semantics: you are saying that a field that should always be Some may be None, just because of what happens in the destructor. Of course this conversely makes a lot of sense: you can call arbitrary methods on self during the destructor, and this should prevent you from ever doing so after deinitializing the field. Not that it will prevent you from producing any other arbitrarily invalid state in there.

On balance this is an ok choice. Certainly what you should reach for by default. However, in the future we expect there to be a first-class way to announce that a field shouldn't be automatically dropped.

## Leaking

Ownership-based resource management is intended to simplify composition. You acquire resources when you create the object, and you release the resources when it gets destroyed. Since destruction is handled for you, it means you can't forget to release the resources, and it happens as soon as possible! Surely this is perfect and all of our problems are solved.

Everything is terrible and we have new and exotic problems to try to solve.

Many people like to believe that Rust eliminates resource leaks. In practice, this is basically true. You would be surprised to see a Safe Rust program leak resources in an uncontrolled way.

However from a theoretical perspective this is absolutely not the case, no matter how you look at it. In the strictest sense, "leaking" is so abstract as to be unpreventable. It's quite trivial to initialize a collection at the start of a program, fill it with tons of objects with destructors, and then enter an infinite event loop that never refers to it. The collection will sit around uselessly, holding on to its precious resources until the program terminates (at which point all those resources would have been reclaimed by the OS anyway).

We may consider a more restricted form of leak: failing to drop a value that is unreachable. Rust also doesn't prevent this. In fact Rust has a function for doing this: mem::forget. This function consumes the value it is passed and then doesn't run its destructor.

In the past mem::forget was marked as unsafe as a sort of lint against using it, since failing to call a destructor is generally not a well-behaved thing to do (though useful for some special unsafe code). However this was generally determined to be an untenable stance to take: there are many ways to fail to call a destructor in safe code. The most famous example is creating a cycle of reference-counted pointers using interior mutability.

It is reasonable for safe code to assume that destructor leaks do not happen, as any program that leaks destructors is probably wrong. However unsafe code cannot rely on destructors to be run in order to be safe. For most types this doesn't matter: if you leak the destructor then the type is by definition inaccessible, so it doesn't matter, right? For instance, if you leak a Box<u8> then you waste some memory but that's hardly going to violate memory-safety.

However where we must be careful with destructor leaks are proxy types. These are types which manage access to a distinct object, but don't actually own it. Proxy objects are quite rare. Proxy objects you'll need to care about are even rarer. However we'll focus on three interesting examples in the standard library:

vec::Drain
Rc
thread::scoped::JoinGuard
Drain

drain is a collections API that moves data out of the container without consuming the container. This enables us to reuse the allocation of a Vec after claiming ownership over all of its contents. It produces an iterator (Drain) that returns the contents of the Vec by-value.

Now, consider Drain in the middle of iteration: some values have been moved out, and others haven't. This means that part of the Vec is now full of logically uninitialized data! We could backshift all the elements in the Vec every time we remove a value, but this would have pretty catastrophic performance consequences.

Instead, we would like Drain to fix the Vec's backing storage when it is dropped. It should run itself to completion, backshift any elements that weren't removed (drain supports subranges), and then fix Vec's len. It's even unwinding-safe! Easy!

Now consider the following:

let mut vec = vec![Box::new(0); 4];

{
    // start draining, vec can no longer be accessed
    let mut drainer = vec.drain(..);

    // pull out two elements and immediately drop them
    drainer.next();
    drainer.next();

    // get rid of drainer, but don't call its destructor
    mem::forget(drainer);
}

// Oops, vec[0] was dropped, we're reading a pointer into free'd memory!
println!("{}", vec[0]);
This is pretty clearly Not Good. Unfortunately, we're kind of stuck between a rock and a hard place: maintaining consistent state at every step has an enormous cost (and would negate any benefits of the API). Failing to maintain consistent state gives us Undefined Behavior in safe code (making the API unsound).

So what can we do? Well, we can pick a trivially consistent state: set the Vec's len to be 0 when we start the iteration, and fix it up if necessary in the destructor. That way, if everything executes like normal we get the desired behavior with minimal overhead. But if someone has the audacity to mem::forget us in the middle of the iteration, all that does is leak even more (and possibly leave the Vec in an unexpected but otherwise consistent state). Since we've accepted that mem::forget is safe, this is definitely safe. We call leaks causing more leaks a leak amplification.

Rc

Rc is an interesting case because at first glance it doesn't appear to be a proxy value at all. After all, it manages the data it points to, and dropping all the Rcs for a value will drop that value. Leaking an Rc doesn't seem like it would be particularly dangerous. It will leave the refcount permanently incremented and prevent the data from being freed or dropped, but that seems just like Box, right?

Nope.

Let's consider a simplified implementation of Rc:

struct Rc<T> {
    ptr: *mut RcBox<T>,
}

struct RcBox<T> {
    data: T,
    ref_count: usize,
}

impl<T> Rc<T> {
    fn new(data: T) -> Self {
        unsafe {
            // Wouldn't it be nice if heap::allocate worked like this?
            let ptr = heap::allocate::<RcBox<T>>();
            ptr::write(ptr, RcBox {
                data,
                ref_count: 1,
            });
            Rc { ptr }
        }
    }

    fn clone(&self) -> Self {
        unsafe {
            (*self.ptr).ref_count += 1;
        }
        Rc { ptr: self.ptr }
    }
}

impl<T> Drop for Rc<T> {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        unsafe {
            (*self.ptr).ref_count -= 1;
            if (*self.ptr).ref_count == 0 {
                // drop the data and then free it
                ptr::read(self.ptr);
                heap::deallocate(self.ptr);
            }
        }
    }
}
This code contains an implicit and subtle assumption: ref_count can fit in a usize, because there can't be more than usize::MAX Rcs in memory. However this itself assumes that the ref_count accurately reflects the number of Rcs in memory, which we know is false with mem::forget. Using mem::forget we can overflow the ref_count, and then get it down to 0 with outstanding Rcs. Then we can happily use-after-free the inner data. Bad Bad Not Good.

This can be solved by just checking the ref_count and doing something. The standard library's stance is to just abort, because your program has become horribly degenerate. Also oh my gosh it's such a ridiculous corner case.

thread::scoped::JoinGuard

Note: This API has already been removed from std, for more information you may refer issue #24292.

This section remains here because we think this example is still important, regardless of whether it is part of std or not.

The thread::scoped API intended to allow threads to be spawned that reference data on their parent's stack without any synchronization over that data by ensuring the parent joins the thread before any of the shared data goes out of scope.

pub fn scoped<'a, F>(f: F) -> JoinGuard<'a>
    where F: FnOnce() + Send + 'a
Here f is some closure for the other thread to execute. Saying that F: Send + 'a is saying that it closes over data that lives for 'a, and it either owns that data or the data was Sync (implying &data is Send).

Because JoinGuard has a lifetime, it keeps all the data it closes over borrowed in the parent thread. This means the JoinGuard can't outlive the data that the other thread is working on. When the JoinGuard does get dropped it blocks the parent thread, ensuring the child terminates before any of the closed-over data goes out of scope in the parent.

Usage looked like:

let mut data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
{
    let mut guards = vec![];
    for x in &mut data {
        // Move the mutable reference into the closure, and execute
        // it on a different thread. The closure has a lifetime bound
        // by the lifetime of the mutable reference `x` we store in it.
        // The guard that is returned is in turn assigned the lifetime
        // of the closure, so it also mutably borrows `data` as `x` did.
        // This means we cannot access `data` until the guard goes away.
        let guard = thread::scoped(move || {
            *x *= 2;
        });
        // store the thread's guard for later
        guards.push(guard);
    }
    // All guards are dropped here, forcing the threads to join
    // (this thread blocks here until the others terminate).
    // Once the threads join, the borrow expires and the data becomes
    // accessible again in this thread.
}
// data is definitely mutated here.
In principle, this totally works! Rust's ownership system perfectly ensures it! ...except it relies on a destructor being called to be safe.

let mut data = Box::new(0);
{
    let guard = thread::scoped(|| {
        // This is at best a data race. At worst, it's also a use-after-free.
        *data += 1;
    });
    // Because the guard is forgotten, expiring the loan without blocking this
    // thread.
    mem::forget(guard);
}
// So the Box is dropped here while the scoped thread may or may not be trying
// to access it.
Dang. Here the destructor running was pretty fundamental to the API, and it had to be scrapped in favor of a completely different design.

# Type Conversions
At the end of the day, everything is just a pile of bits somewhere, and type systems are just there to help us use those bits right. There are two common problems with typing bits: needing to reinterpret those exact bits as a different type, and needing to change the bits to have equivalent meaning for a different type. Because Rust encourages encoding important properties in the type system, these problems are incredibly pervasive. As such, Rust consequently gives you several ways to solve them.

First we'll look at the ways that Safe Rust gives you to reinterpret values. The most trivial way to do this is to just destructure a value into its constituent parts and then build a new type out of them. e.g.

struct Foo {
    x: u32,
    y: u16,
}

struct Bar {
    a: u32,
    b: u16,
}

fn reinterpret(foo: Foo) -> Bar {
    let Foo { x, y } = foo;
    Bar { a: x, b: y }
}
But this is, at best, annoying. For common conversions, Rust provides more ergonomic alternatives.

## Coercions

Types can implicitly be coerced to change in certain contexts. These changes are generally just weakening of types, largely focused around pointers and lifetimes. They mostly exist to make Rust "just work" in more cases, and are largely harmless.

For an exhaustive list of all the types of coercions, see the Coercion types section on the reference.

Note that we do not perform coercions when matching traits (except for receivers, see the next page). If there is an impl for some type U and T coerces to U, that does not constitute an implementation for T. For example, the following will not type check, even though it is OK to coerce t to &T and there is an impl for &T:

trait Trait {}

fn foo<X: Trait>(t: X) {}

impl<'a> Trait for &'a i32 {}

fn main() {
    let t: &mut i32 = &mut 0;
    foo(t);
}
which fails like as follows:

error[E0277]: the trait bound `&mut i32: Trait` is not satisfied
 --> src/main.rs:9:9
  |
3 | fn foo<X: Trait>(t: X) {}
  |           ----- required by this bound in `foo`
...
9 |     foo(t);
  |         ^ the trait `Trait` is not implemented for `&mut i32`
  |
  = help: the following implementations were found:
            <&'a i32 as Trait>
  = note: `Trait` is implemented for `&i32`, but not for `&mut i32`
## The Dot Operator

The dot operator will perform a lot of magic to convert types. It will perform auto-referencing, auto-dereferencing, and coercion until types match. The detailed mechanics of method lookup are defined here, but here is a brief overview that outlines the main steps.

Suppose we have a function foo that has a receiver (a self, &self or &mut self parameter). If we call value.foo(), the compiler needs to determine what type Self is before it can call the correct implementation of the function. For this example, we will say that value has type T.

We will use fully-qualified syntax to be more clear about exactly which type we are calling a function on.

First, the compiler checks if it can call T::foo(value) directly. This is called a "by value" method call.
If it can't call this function (for example, if the function has the wrong type or a trait isn't implemented for Self), then the compiler tries to add in an automatic reference. This means that the compiler tries <&T>::foo(value) and <&mut T>::foo(value). This is called an "autoref" method call.
If none of these candidates worked, it dereferences T and tries again. This uses the Deref trait - if T: Deref<Target = U> then it tries again with type U instead of T. If it can't dereference T, it can also try unsizing T. This just means that if T has a size parameter known at compile time, it "forgets" it for the purpose of resolving methods. For instance, this unsizing step can convert [i32; 2] into [i32] by "forgetting" the size of the array.
Here is an example of the method lookup algorithm:

let array: Rc<Box<[T; 3]>> = ...;
let first_entry = array[0];
How does the compiler actually compute array[0] when the array is behind so many indirections? First, array[0] is really just syntax sugar for the Index trait - the compiler will convert array[0] into array.index(0). Now, the compiler checks to see if array implements Index, so that it can call the function.

Then, the compiler checks if Rc<Box<[T; 3]>> implements Index, but it does not, and neither do &Rc<Box<[T; 3]>> or &mut Rc<Box<[T; 3]>>. Since none of these worked, the compiler dereferences the Rc<Box<[T; 3]>> into Box<[T; 3]> and tries again. Box<[T; 3]>, &Box<[T; 3]>, and &mut Box<[T; 3]> do not implement Index, so it dereferences again. [T; 3] and its autorefs also do not implement Index. It can't dereference [T; 3], so the compiler unsizes it, giving [T]. Finally, [T] implements Index, so it can now call the actual index function.

Consider the following more complicated example of the dot operator at work:

fn do_stuff<T: Clone>(value: &T) {
    let cloned = value.clone();
}
What type is cloned? First, the compiler checks if it can call by value. The type of value is &T, and so the clone function has signature fn clone(&T) -> T. It knows that T: Clone, so the compiler finds that cloned: T.

What would happen if the T: Clone restriction was removed? It would not be able to call by value, since there is no implementation of Clone for T. So the compiler tries to call by autoref. In this case, the function has the signature fn clone(&&T) -> &T since Self = &T. The compiler sees that &T: Clone, and then deduces that cloned: &T.

Here is another example where the autoref behavior is used to create some subtle effects:

#[derive(Clone)]
struct Container<T>(Arc<T>);

fn clone_containers<T>(foo: &Container<i32>, bar: &Container<T>) {
    let foo_cloned = foo.clone();
    let bar_cloned = bar.clone();
}
What types are foo_cloned and bar_cloned? We know that Container<i32>: Clone, so the compiler calls clone by value to give foo_cloned: Container<i32>. However, bar_cloned actually has type &Container<T>. Surely this doesn't make sense - we added #[derive(Clone)] to Container, so it must implement Clone! Looking closer, the code generated by the derive macro is (roughly):

impl<T> Clone for Container<T> where T: Clone {
    fn clone(&self) -> Self {
        Self(Arc::clone(&self.0))
    }
}
The derived Clone implementation is only defined where T: Clone, so there is no implementation for Container<T>: Clone for a generic T. The compiler then looks to see if &Container<T> implements Clone, which it does. So it deduces that clone is called by autoref, and so bar_cloned has type &Container<T>.

We can fix this by implementing Clone manually without requiring T: Clone:

impl<T> Clone for Container<T> {
    fn clone(&self) -> Self {
        Self(Arc::clone(&self.0))
    }
}
Now, the type checker deduces that bar_cloned: Container<T>.

## Casts

Casts are a superset of coercions: every coercion can be explicitly invoked via a cast. However some conversions require a cast. While coercions are pervasive and largely harmless, these "true casts" are rare and potentially dangerous. As such, casts must be explicitly invoked using the as keyword: expr as Type.

You can find an exhaustive list of all the true casts and casting semantics on the reference.

Safety of casting

True casts generally revolve around raw pointers and the primitive numeric types. Even though they're dangerous, these casts are infallible at runtime. If a cast triggers some subtle corner case no indication will be given that this occurred. The cast will simply succeed. That said, casts must be valid at the type level, or else they will be prevented statically. For instance, 7u8 as bool will not compile.

That said, casts aren't unsafe because they generally can't violate memory safety on their own. For instance, converting an integer to a raw pointer can very easily lead to terrible things. However the act of creating the pointer itself is safe, because actually using a raw pointer is already marked as unsafe.

Some notes about casting

Lengths when casting raw slices

Note that lengths are not adjusted when casting raw slices; *const [u16] as *const [u8] creates a slice that only includes half of the original memory.

Transitivity

Casting is not transitive, that is, even if e as U1 as U2 is a valid expression, e as U2 is not necessarily so.

## Transmutes

Get out of our way type system! We're going to reinterpret these bits or die trying! Even though this book is all about doing things that are unsafe, I really can't emphasize enough that you should deeply think about finding Another Way than the operations covered in this section. This is really, truly, the most horribly unsafe thing you can do in Rust. The guardrails here are dental floss.

mem::transmute<T, U> takes a value of type T and reinterprets it to have type U. The only restriction is that the T and U are verified to have the same size. The ways to cause Undefined Behavior with this are mind boggling.

First and foremost, creating an instance of any type with an invalid state is going to cause arbitrary chaos that can't really be predicted. Do not transmute 3 to bool. Even if you never do anything with the bool. Just don't.

Transmute has an overloaded return type. If you do not specify the return type it may produce a surprising type to satisfy inference.

Transmuting an & to &mut is Undefined Behavior. While certain usages may appear safe, note that the Rust optimizer is free to assume that a shared reference won't change through its lifetime and thus such transmutation will run afoul of those assumptions. So:

Transmuting an & to &mut is always Undefined Behavior.
No you can't do it.
No you're not special.
Transmuting to a reference without an explicitly provided lifetime produces an unbounded lifetime.

When transmuting between different compound types, you have to make sure they are laid out the same way! If layouts differ, the wrong fields are going to get filled with the wrong data, which will make you unhappy and can also be Undefined Behavior (see above).

So how do you know if the layouts are the same? For repr(C) types and repr(transparent) types, layout is precisely defined. But for your run-of-the-mill repr(Rust), it is not. Even different instances of the same generic type can have wildly different layout. Vec<i32> and Vec<u32> might have their fields in the same order, or they might not. The details of what exactly is and is not guaranteed for data layout are still being worked out over at the UCG WG.

mem::transmute_copy<T, U> somehow manages to be even more wildly unsafe than this. It copies size_of<U> bytes out of an &T and interprets them as a U. The size check that mem::transmute has is gone (as it may be valid to copy out a prefix), though it is Undefined Behavior for U to be larger than T.

Also of course you can get all of the functionality of these functions using raw pointer casts or unions, but without any of the lints or other basic sanity checks. Raw pointer casts and unions do not magically avoid the above rules.

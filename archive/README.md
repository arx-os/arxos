- `hcps_fixed.html` - Bug fix iteration
- `hcps_improved.html` - Performance improvements
- `hcps_final.html` - Final version (superseded by diagnostic tools)

### Size Optimization Tests
- `arxos_10kb.html` - 10KB size optimization test
- `arxos_14kb.html` - 14KB size optimization test
- `arxos_14kb_pro.html` - 14KB professional version test

### Test Data
- `alafia_es_data.json` - Sample data from Alafia ES floor plan
- `process_alafia.js` - Processing script for Alafia data

### Planning Documents

## Note

These files are archived and not maintained. For current implementations, see:
- `/demos/` - Current demo applications
- `/core/extraction/` - Production extraction modules
- `/demos/hcps_diagnostic_v3.html` - Latest diagnostic tool with 1:1 accuracy

## Why Keep These?

These files document the evolution of the PDF extraction system:
- Shows progression from 21 → 33 → 40 → 576+ walls extraction
- Contains different approaches and optimizations tried
- Useful for understanding design decisions and trade-offs

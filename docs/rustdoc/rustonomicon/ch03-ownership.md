# Ownership
Ownership is the breakout feature of Rust. It allows Rust to be completely memory-safe and efficient, while avoiding garbage collection. Before getting into the ownership system in detail, we will consider the motivation of this design.

We will assume that you accept that garbage collection (GC) is not always an optimal solution, and that it is desirable to manually manage memory in some contexts. If you do not accept this, might I interest you in a different language?

Regardless of your feelings on GC, it is pretty clearly a massive boon to making code safe. You never have to worry about things going away too soon (although whether you still wanted to be pointing at that thing is a different issue...). This is a pervasive problem that C and C++ programs need to deal with. Consider this simple mistake that all of us who have used a non-GC'd language have made at one point:

fn as_str(data: &u32) -> &str {
    // compute the string
    let s = format!("{}", data);

    // OH NO! We returned a reference to something that
    // exists only in this function!
    // Dangling pointer! Use after free! Alas!
    // (this does not compile in Rust)
    &s
}
This is exactly what Rust's ownership system was built to solve. Rust knows the scope in which the &s lives, and as such can prevent it from escaping. However this is a simple case that even a C compiler could plausibly catch. Things get more complicated as code gets bigger and pointers get fed through various functions. Eventually, a C compiler will fall down and won't be able to perform sufficient escape analysis to prove your code unsound. It will consequently be forced to accept your program on the assumption that it is correct.

This will never happen to Rust. It's up to the programmer to prove to the compiler that everything is sound.

Of course, Rust's story around ownership is much more complicated than just verifying that references don't escape the scope of their referent. That's because ensuring pointers are always valid is much more complicated than this. For instance in this code,

let mut data = vec![1, 2, 3];
// get an internal reference
let x = &data[0];

// OH NO! `push` causes the backing storage of `data` to be reallocated.
// Dangling pointer! Use after free! Alas!
// (this does not compile in Rust)
data.push(4);

println!("{}", x);
naive scope analysis would be insufficient to prevent this bug, because data does in fact live as long as we needed. However it was changed while we had a reference into it. This is why Rust requires any references to freeze the referent and its owners.

## References

There are two kinds of references:

Shared reference: &
Mutable reference: &mut
Which obey the following rules:

A reference cannot outlive its referent
A mutable reference cannot be aliased
That's it. That's the whole model references follow.

Of course, we should probably define what aliased means.

error: aborting due to previous error
Unfortunately, Rust hasn't actually defined its aliasing model. 🙀

While we wait for the Rust devs to specify the semantics of their language, let's use the next section to discuss what aliasing is in general, and why it matters.

## Aliasing

First off, let's get some important caveats out of the way:

We will be using the broadest possible definition of aliasing for the sake of discussion. Rust's definition will probably be more restricted to factor in mutations and liveness.

We will be assuming a single-threaded, interrupt-free, execution. We will also be ignoring things like memory-mapped hardware. Rust assumes these things don't happen unless you tell it otherwise. For more details, see the Concurrency Chapter.

With that said, here's our working definition: variables and pointers alias if they refer to overlapping regions of memory.

Why Aliasing Matters

So why should we care about aliasing?

Consider this simple function:

fn compute(input: &u32, output: &mut u32) {
    if *input > 10 {
        *output = 1;
    }
    if *input > 5 {
        *output *= 2;
    }
    // remember that `output` will be `2` if `input > 10`
}
We would like to be able to optimize it to the following function:

fn compute(input: &u32, output: &mut u32) {
    let cached_input = *input; // keep `*input` in a register
    if cached_input > 10 {
        // If the input is greater than 10, the previous code would set the output to 1 and then double it,
        // resulting in an output of 2 (because `>10` implies `>5`).
        // Here, we avoid the double assignment and just set it directly to 2.
        *output = 2;
    } else if cached_input > 5 {
        *output *= 2;
    }
}
In Rust, this optimization should be sound. For almost any other language, it wouldn't be (barring global analysis). This is because the optimization relies on knowing that aliasing doesn't occur, which most languages are fairly liberal with. Specifically, we need to worry about function arguments that make input and output overlap, such as compute(&x, &mut x).

With that input, we could get this execution:

                    //  input ==  output == 0xabad1dea
                    // *input == *output == 20
if *input > 10 {    // true  (*input == 20)
    *output = 1;    // also overwrites *input, because they are the same
}
if *input > 5 {     // false (*input == 1)
    *output *= 2;
}
                    // *input == *output == 1
Our optimized function would produce *output == 2 for this input, so the correctness of our optimization relies on this input being impossible.

In Rust we know this input should be impossible because &mut isn't allowed to be aliased. So we can safely reject its possibility and perform this optimization. In most other languages, this input would be entirely possible, and must be considered.

This is why alias analysis is important: it lets the compiler perform useful optimizations! Some examples:

keeping values in registers by proving no pointers access the value's memory
eliminating reads by proving some memory hasn't been written to since last we read it
eliminating writes by proving some memory is never read before the next write to it
moving or reordering reads and writes by proving they don't depend on each other
These optimizations also tend to prove the soundness of bigger optimizations such as loop vectorization, constant propagation, and dead code elimination.

In the previous example, we used the fact that &mut u32 can't be aliased to prove that writes to *output can't possibly affect *input. This lets us cache *input in a register, eliminating a read.

By caching this read, we knew that the write in the > 10 branch couldn't affect whether we take the > 5 branch, allowing us to also eliminate a read-modify-write (doubling *output) when *input > 10.

The key thing to remember about alias analysis is that writes are the primary hazard for optimizations. That is, the only thing that prevents us from moving a read to any other part of the program is the possibility of us re-ordering it with a write to the same location.

For instance, we have no concern for aliasing in the following modified version of our function, because we've moved the only write to *output to the very end of our function. This allows us to freely reorder the reads of *input that occur before it:

fn compute(input: &u32, output: &mut u32) {
    let mut temp = *output;
    if *input > 10 {
        temp = 1;
    }
    if *input > 5 {
        temp *= 2;
    }
    *output = temp;
}
We're still relying on alias analysis to assume that input doesn't alias temp, but the proof is much simpler: the value of a local variable can't be aliased by things that existed before it was declared. This is an assumption every language freely makes, and so this version of the function could be optimized the way we want in any language.

This is why the definition of "alias" that Rust will use likely involves some notion of liveness and mutation: we don't actually care if aliasing occurs if there aren't any actual writes to memory happening.

Of course, a full aliasing model for Rust must also take into consideration things like function calls (which may mutate things we don't see), raw pointers (which have no aliasing requirements on their own), and UnsafeCell (which lets the referent of an & be mutated).

## Lifetimes

Rust enforces these rules through lifetimes. Lifetimes are named regions of code that a reference must be valid for. Those regions may be fairly complex, as they correspond to paths of execution in the program. There may even be holes in these paths of execution, as it's possible to invalidate a reference as long as it's reinitialized before it's used again. Types which contain references (or pretend to) may also be tagged with lifetimes so that Rust can prevent them from being invalidated as well.

In most of our examples, the lifetimes will coincide with scopes. This is because our examples are simple. The more complex cases where they don't coincide are described below.

Within a function body, Rust generally doesn't let you explicitly name the lifetimes involved. This is because it's generally not really necessary to talk about lifetimes in a local context; Rust has all the information and can work out everything as optimally as possible. Many anonymous scopes and temporaries that you would otherwise have to write are often introduced to make your code Just Work.

However once you cross the function boundary, you need to start talking about lifetimes. Lifetimes are denoted with an apostrophe: 'a, 'static. To dip our toes with lifetimes, we're going to pretend that we're actually allowed to label scopes with lifetimes, and desugar the examples from the start of this chapter.

Originally, our examples made use of aggressive sugar -- high fructose corn syrup even -- around scopes and lifetimes, because writing everything out explicitly is extremely noisy. All Rust code relies on aggressive inference and elision of "obvious" things.

One particularly interesting piece of sugar is that each let statement implicitly introduces a scope. For the most part, this doesn't really matter. However it does matter for variables that refer to each other. As a simple example, let's completely desugar this simple piece of Rust code:

let x = 0;
let y = &x;
let z = &y;
The borrow checker always tries to minimize the extent of a lifetime, so it will likely desugar to the following:

// NOTE: `'a: {` and `&'b x` is not valid syntax!
'a: {
    let x: i32 = 0;
    'b: {
        // lifetime used is 'b because that's good enough.
        let y: &'b i32 = &'b x;
        'c: {
            // ditto on 'c
            let z: &'c &'b i32 = &'c y; // "a reference to a reference to an i32" (with lifetimes annotated)
        }
    }
}
Wow. That's... awful. Let's all take a moment to thank Rust for making this easier.

Actually passing references to outer scopes will cause Rust to infer a larger lifetime:

let x = 0;
let z;
let y = &x;
z = y;
'a: {
    let x: i32 = 0;
    'b: {
        let z: &'b i32;
        'c: {
            // Must use 'b here because the reference to x is
            // being passed to the scope 'b.
            let y: &'b i32 = &'b x;
            z = y;
        }
    }
}
Example: references that outlive referents

Alright, let's look at some of those examples from before:

fn as_str(data: &u32) -> &str {
    let s = format!("{}", data);
    &s
}
desugars to:

fn as_str<'a>(data: &'a u32) -> &'a str {
    'b: {
        let s = format!("{}", data);
        return &'a s;
    }
}
This signature of as_str takes a reference to a u32 with some lifetime, and promises that it can produce a reference to a str that can live just as long. Already we can see why this signature might be trouble. That basically implies that we're going to find a str somewhere in the scope the reference to the u32 originated in, or somewhere even earlier. That's a bit of a tall order.

We then proceed to compute the string s, and return a reference to it. Since the contract of our function says the reference must outlive 'a, that's the lifetime we infer for the reference. Unfortunately, s was defined in the scope 'b, so the only way this is sound is if 'b contains 'a -- which is clearly false since 'a must contain the function call itself. We have therefore created a reference whose lifetime outlives its referent, which is literally the first thing we said that references can't do. The compiler rightfully blows up in our face.

To make this more clear, we can expand the example:

fn as_str<'a>(data: &'a u32) -> &'a str {
    'b: {
        let s = format!("{}", data);
        return &'a s
    }
}

fn main() {
    'c: {
        let x: u32 = 0;
        'd: {
            // An anonymous scope is introduced because the borrow does not
            // need to last for the whole scope x is valid for. The return
            // of as_str must find a str somewhere before this function
            // call. Obviously not happening.
            println!("{}", as_str::<'d>(&'d x));
        }
    }
}
Shoot!

Of course, the right way to write this function is as follows:

fn to_string(data: &u32) -> String {
    format!("{}", data)
}
We must produce an owned value inside the function to return it! The only way we could have returned an &'a str would have been if it was in a field of the &'a u32, which is obviously not the case.

(Actually we could have also just returned a string literal, which as a global can be considered to reside at the bottom of the stack; though this limits our implementation just a bit.)

Example: aliasing a mutable reference

How about the other example:

let mut data = vec![1, 2, 3];
let x = &data[0];
data.push(4);
println!("{}", x);
'a: {
    let mut data: Vec<i32> = vec![1, 2, 3];
    'b: {
        // 'b is as big as we need this borrow to be
        // (just need to get to `println!`)
        let x: &'b i32 = Index::index::<'b>(&'b data, 0);
        'c: {
            // Temporary scope because we don't need the
            // &mut to last any longer.
            Vec::push(&'c mut data, 4);
        }
        println!("{}", x);
    }
}
The problem here is a bit more subtle and interesting. We want Rust to reject this program for the following reason: We have a live shared reference x to a descendant of data when we try to take a mutable reference to data to push. This would create an aliased mutable reference, which would violate the second rule of references.

However this is not at all how Rust reasons that this program is bad. Rust doesn't understand that x is a reference to a subpath of data. It doesn't understand Vec at all. What it does see is that x has to live for 'b in order to be printed. The signature of Index::index subsequently demands that the reference we take to data has to survive for 'b. When we try to call push, it then sees us try to make an &'c mut data. Rust knows that 'c is contained within 'b, and rejects our program because the &'b data must still be alive!

Here we see that the lifetime system is much more coarse than the reference semantics we're actually interested in preserving. For the most part, that's totally ok, because it keeps us from spending all day explaining our program to the compiler. However it does mean that several programs that are totally correct with respect to Rust's true semantics are rejected because lifetimes are too dumb.

The area covered by a lifetime

A reference (sometimes called a borrow) is alive from the place it is created to its last use. The borrowed value needs to outlive only borrows that are alive. This looks simple, but there are a few subtleties.

The following snippet compiles, because after printing x, it is no longer needed, so it doesn't matter if it is dangling or aliased (even though the variable x technically exists to the very end of the scope).

let mut data = vec![1, 2, 3];
let x = &data[0];
println!("{}", x);
// This is OK, x is no longer needed
data.push(4);
However, if the value has a destructor, the destructor is run at the end of the scope. And running the destructor is considered a use ‒ obviously the last one. So, this will not compile.

#[derive(Debug)]
struct X<'a>(&'a i32);

impl Drop for X<'_> {
    fn drop(&mut self) {}
}

let mut data = vec![1, 2, 3];
let x = X(&data[0]);
println!("{:?}", x);
data.push(4);
// Here, the destructor is run and therefore this'll fail to compile.
One way to convince the compiler that x is no longer valid is by using drop(x) before data.push(4).

Furthermore, there might be multiple possible last uses of the borrow, for example in each branch of a condition.

let mut data = vec![1, 2, 3];
let x = &data[0];

if some_condition() {
    println!("{}", x); // This is the last use of `x` in this branch
    data.push(4);      // So we can push here
} else {
    // There's no use of `x` in here, so effectively the last use is the
    // creation of x at the top of the example.
    data.push(5);
}
And a lifetime can have a pause in it. Or you might look at it as two distinct borrows just being tied to the same local variable. This often happens around loops (writing a new value of a variable at the end of the loop and using it for the last time at the top of the next iteration).

let mut data = vec![1, 2, 3];
// This mut allows us to change where the reference points to
let mut x = &data[0];

println!("{}", x); // Last use of this borrow
data.push(4);
x = &data[3]; // We start a new borrow here
println!("{}", x);
Historically, Rust kept the borrow alive until the end of scope, so these examples might fail to compile with older compilers. Also, there are still some corner cases where Rust fails to properly shorten the live part of the borrow and fails to compile even when it looks like it should. These'll be solved over time.

## Limits of Lifetimes

Given the following code:

#[derive(Debug)]
struct Foo;

impl Foo {
    fn mutate_and_share(&mut self) -> &Self { &*self }
    fn share(&self) {}
}

fn main() {
    let mut foo = Foo;
    let loan = foo.mutate_and_share();
    foo.share();
    println!("{:?}", loan);
}
One might expect it to compile. We call mutate_and_share, which mutably borrows foo temporarily, but then returns only a shared reference. Therefore we would expect foo.share() to succeed as foo shouldn't be mutably borrowed.

However when we try to compile it:

error[E0502]: cannot borrow `foo` as immutable because it is also borrowed as mutable
  --> src/main.rs:12:5
   |
11 |     let loan = foo.mutate_and_share();
   |                --- mutable borrow occurs here
12 |     foo.share();
   |     ^^^ immutable borrow occurs here
13 |     println!("{:?}", loan);
What happened? Well, we got the exact same reasoning as we did for Example 2 in the previous section. We desugar the program and we get the following:

struct Foo;

impl Foo {
    fn mutate_and_share<'a>(&'a mut self) -> &'a Self { &'a *self }
    fn share<'a>(&'a self) {}
}

fn main() {
    'b: {
        let mut foo: Foo = Foo;
        'c: {
            let loan: &'c Foo = Foo::mutate_and_share::<'c>(&'c mut foo);
            'd: {
                Foo::share::<'d>(&'d foo);
            }
            println!("{:?}", loan);
        }
    }
}
The lifetime system is forced to extend the &mut foo to have lifetime 'c, due to the lifetime of loan and mutate_and_share's signature. Then when we try to call share, it sees we're trying to alias that &'c mut foo and blows up in our face!

This program is clearly correct according to the reference semantics we actually care about, but the lifetime system is too coarse-grained to handle that.

Improperly reduced borrows

The following code fails to compile, because Rust sees that a variable, map, is borrowed twice, and can not infer that the first borrow ceases to be needed before the second one occurs. This is caused by Rust conservatively falling back to using a whole scope for the first borrow. This will eventually get fixed.

fn get_default<'m, K, V>(map: &'m mut HashMap<K, V>, key: K) -> &'m mut V
where
    K: Clone + Eq + Hash,
    V: Default,
{
    match map.get_mut(&key) {
        Some(value) => value,
        None => {
            map.insert(key.clone(), V::default());
            map.get_mut(&key).unwrap()
        }
    }
}
Because of the lifetime restrictions imposed, &mut map's lifetime overlaps other mutable borrows, resulting in a compile error:

error[E0499]: cannot borrow `*map` as mutable more than once at a time
  --> src/main.rs:12:13
   |
4  |   fn get_default<'m, K, V>(map: &'m mut HashMap<K, V>, key: K) -> &'m mut V
   |                  -- lifetime `'m` defined here
...
9  |       match map.get_mut(&key) {
   |       -     --- first mutable borrow occurs here
   |  _____|
   | |
10 | |         Some(value) => value,
11 | |         None => {
12 | |             map.insert(key.clone(), V::default());
   | |             ^^^ second mutable borrow occurs here
13 | |             map.get_mut(&key).unwrap()
14 | |         }
15 | |     }
   | |_____- returning this value requires that `*map` is borrowed for `'m`
## Lifetime Elision

In order to make common patterns more ergonomic, Rust allows lifetimes to be elided in function signatures.

A lifetime position is anywhere you can write a lifetime in a type:

&'a T
&'a mut T
T<'a>
Lifetime positions can appear as either "input" or "output":

For fn definitions, fn types, and the traits Fn, FnMut, and FnOnce, input refers to the types of the formal arguments, while output refers to result types. So fn foo(s: &str) -> (&str, &str) has elided one lifetime in input position and two lifetimes in output position. Note that the input positions of a fn method definition do not include the lifetimes that occur in the method's impl header (nor lifetimes that occur in the trait header, for a default method).

For impl headers, all types are input. So impl Trait<&T> for Struct<&T> has elided two lifetimes in input position, while impl Struct<&T> has elided one.

Elision rules are as follows:

Each elided lifetime in input position becomes a distinct lifetime parameter.

If there is exactly one input lifetime position (elided or not), that lifetime is assigned to all elided output lifetimes.

If there are multiple input lifetime positions, but one of them is &self or &mut self, the lifetime of self is assigned to all elided output lifetimes.

Otherwise, it is an error to elide an output lifetime.

Examples:

fn print(s: &str);                                      // elided
fn print<'a>(s: &'a str);                               // expanded

fn debug(lvl: usize, s: &str);                          // elided
fn debug<'a>(lvl: usize, s: &'a str);                   // expanded

fn substr(s: &str, until: usize) -> &str;               // elided
fn substr<'a>(s: &'a str, until: usize) -> &'a str;     // expanded

fn get_str() -> &str;                                   // ILLEGAL

fn frob(s: &str, t: &str) -> &str;                      // ILLEGAL

fn get_mut(&mut self) -> &mut T;                        // elided
fn get_mut<'a>(&'a mut self) -> &'a mut T;              // expanded

fn args<T: ToCStr>(&mut self, args: &[T]) -> &mut Command                  // elided
fn args<'a, 'b, T: ToCStr>(&'a mut self, args: &'b [T]) -> &'a mut Command // expanded

fn new(buf: &mut [u8]) -> BufWriter;                    // elided
fn new(buf: &mut [u8]) -> BufWriter<'_>;                // elided (with `rust_2018_idioms`)
fn new<'a>(buf: &'a mut [u8]) -> BufWriter<'a>          // expanded
## Unbounded Lifetimes

Unsafe code can often end up producing references or lifetimes out of thin air. Such lifetimes come into the world as unbounded. The most common source of this is taking a reference to a dereferenced raw pointer, which produces a reference with an unbounded lifetime. Such a lifetime becomes as big as context demands. This is in fact more powerful than simply becoming 'static, because for instance &'static &'a T will fail to typecheck, but the unbound lifetime will perfectly mold into &'a &'a T as needed. However for most intents and purposes, such an unbounded lifetime can be regarded as 'static.

Almost no reference is 'static, so this is probably wrong. transmute and transmute_copy are the two other primary offenders. One should endeavor to bound an unbounded lifetime as quickly as possible, especially across function boundaries.

Given a function, any output lifetimes that don't derive from inputs are unbounded. For instance:

fn get_str<'a>(s: *const String) -> &'a str {
    unsafe { &*s }
}

fn main() {
    let soon_dropped = String::from("hello");
    let dangling = get_str(&soon_dropped);
    drop(soon_dropped);
    println!("Invalid str: {}", dangling); // Invalid str: gӚ_`
}
The easiest way to avoid unbounded lifetimes is to use lifetime elision at the function boundary. If an output lifetime is elided, then it must be bounded by an input lifetime. Of course it might be bounded by the wrong lifetime, but this will usually just cause a compiler error, rather than allow memory safety to be trivially violated.

Within a function, bounding lifetimes is more error-prone. The safest and easiest way to bound a lifetime is to return it from a function with a bound lifetime. However if this is unacceptable, the reference can be placed in a location with a specific lifetime. Unfortunately it's impossible to name all lifetimes involved in a function.

## Higher-Rank Trait Bounds

Rust's Fn traits are a little bit magic. For instance, we can write the following code:

struct Closure<F> {
    data: (u8, u16),
    func: F,
}

impl<F> Closure<F>
    where F: Fn(&(u8, u16)) -> &u8,
{
    fn call(&self) -> &u8 {
        (self.func)(&self.data)
    }
}

fn do_it(data: &(u8, u16)) -> &u8 { &data.0 }

fn main() {
    let clo = Closure { data: (0, 1), func: do_it };
    println!("{}", clo.call());
}
If we try to naively desugar this code in the same way that we did in the lifetimes section, we run into some trouble:

// NOTE: `&'b data.0` and `'x: {` is not valid syntax!
struct Closure<F> {
    data: (u8, u16),
    func: F,
}

impl<F> Closure<F>
    // where F: Fn(&'??? (u8, u16)) -> &'??? u8,
{
    fn call<'a>(&'a self) -> &'a u8 {
        (self.func)(&self.data)
    }
}

fn do_it<'b>(data: &'b (u8, u16)) -> &'b u8 { &'b data.0 }

fn main() {
    'x: {
        let clo = Closure { data: (0, 1), func: do_it };
        println!("{}", clo.call());
    }
}
How on earth are we supposed to express the lifetimes on F's trait bound? We need to provide some lifetime there, but the lifetime we care about can't be named until we enter the body of call! Also, that isn't some fixed lifetime; call works with any lifetime &self happens to have at that point.

This job requires The Magic of Higher-Rank Trait Bounds (HRTBs). The way we desugar this is as follows:

where for<'a> F: Fn(&'a (u8, u16)) -> &'a u8,
Alternatively:

where F: for<'a> Fn(&'a (u8, u16)) -> &'a u8,
(Where Fn(a, b, c) -> d is itself just sugar for the unstable real Fn trait)

for<'a> can be read as "for all choices of 'a", and basically produces an infinite list of trait bounds that F must satisfy. Intense. There aren't many places outside of the Fn traits where we encounter HRTBs, and even for those we have a nice magic sugar for the common cases.

In summary, we can rewrite the original code more explicitly as:

struct Closure<F> {
    data: (u8, u16),
    func: F,
}

impl<F> Closure<F>
    where for<'a> F: Fn(&'a (u8, u16)) -> &'a u8,
{
    fn call(&self) -> &u8 {
        (self.func)(&self.data)
    }
}

fn do_it(data: &(u8, u16)) -> &u8 { &data.0 }

fn main() {
    let clo = Closure { data: (0, 1), func: do_it };
    println!("{}", clo.call());
}
## Subtyping and Variance

Rust uses lifetimes to track the relationships between borrows and ownership. However, a naive implementation of lifetimes would be either too restrictive, or permit undefined behavior.

In order to allow flexible usage of lifetimes while also preventing their misuse, Rust uses subtyping and variance.

Let's start with an example.

// Note: debug expects two parameters with the *same* lifetime
fn debug<'a>(a: &'a str, b: &'a str) {
    println!("a = {a:?} b = {b:?}");
}

fn main() {
    let hello: &'static str = "hello";
    {
        let world = String::from("world");
        let world = &world; // 'world has a shorter lifetime than 'static
        debug(hello, world);
    }
}
In a conservative implementation of lifetimes, since hello and world have different lifetimes, we might see the following error:

error[E0308]: mismatched types
 --> src/main.rs:10:16
   |
10 |         debug(hello, world);
   |                      ^
   |                      |
   |                      expected `&'static str`, found struct `&'world str`
This would be rather unfortunate. In this case, what we want is to accept any type that lives at least as long as 'world. Let's try using subtyping with our lifetimes.

Subtyping

Subtyping is the idea that one type can be used in place of another.

Let's define that Sub is a subtype of Super (we'll be using the notation Sub <: Super throughout this chapter).

What this is suggesting to us is that the set of requirements that Super defines are completely satisfied by Sub. Sub may then have more requirements.

Now, in order to use subtyping with lifetimes, we need to define the requirement of a lifetime:

'a defines a region of code.

Now that we have a defined set of requirements for lifetimes, we can define how they relate to each other:

'long <: 'short if and only if 'long defines a region of code that completely contains 'short.

'long may define a region larger than 'short, but that still fits our definition.

As we will see throughout the rest of this chapter, subtyping is a lot more complicated and subtle than this, but this simple rule is a very good 99% intuition. And unless you write unsafe code, the compiler will automatically handle all the corner cases for you.

But this is the Rustonomicon. We're writing unsafe code, so we need to understand how this stuff really works, and how we can mess it up.

Going back to our example above, we can say that 'static <: 'world. For now, let's also accept the idea that subtypes of lifetimes can be passed through references (more on this in Variance), e.g. &'static str is a subtype of &'world str, then we can "downgrade" &'static str into a &'world str. With that, the example above will compile:

fn debug<'a>(a: &'a str, b: &'a str) {
    println!("a = {a:?} b = {b:?}");
}

fn main() {
    let hello: &'static str = "hello";
    {
        let world = String::from("world");
        let world = &world; // 'world has a shorter lifetime than 'static
        debug(hello, world); // hello silently downgrades from `&'static str` into `&'world str`
    }
}
Variance

Above, we glossed over the fact that 'static <: 'b implied that &'static T <: &'b T. This uses a property known as variance. It's not always as simple as this example, though. To understand that, let's try to extend this example a bit:

fn assign<T>(input: &mut T, val: T) {
    *input = val;
}

fn main() {
    let mut hello: &'static str = "hello";
    {
        let world = String::from("world");
        assign(&mut hello, &world);
    }
    println!("{hello}"); // use after free 😿
}
In assign, we are setting the hello reference to point to world. But then world goes out of scope, before the later use of hello in the println!

This is a classic use-after-free bug!

Our first instinct might be to blame the assign impl, but there's really nothing wrong here. It shouldn't be surprising that we might want to assign a T into a T.

The problem is that we cannot assume that &mut &'static str and &mut &'b str are compatible. This means that &mut &'static str cannot be a subtype of &mut &'b str, even if 'static is a subtype of 'b.

Variance is the concept that Rust borrows to define relationships about subtypes through their generic parameters.

NOTE: For convenience we will define a generic type F<T> so that we can easily talk about T. Hopefully this is clear in context.

The type F's variance is how the subtyping of its inputs affects the subtyping of its outputs. There are three kinds of variance in Rust. Given two types Sub and Super, where Sub is a subtype of Super:

F is covariant if F<Sub> is a subtype of F<Super> (the subtype property is passed through)
F is contravariant if F<Super> is a subtype of F<Sub> (the subtype property is "inverted")
F is invariant otherwise (no subtyping relationship exists)
If we remember from the above examples, it was ok for us to treat &'a T as a subtype of &'b T if 'a <: 'b, therefore we can say that &'a T is covariant over 'a.

Also, we saw that it was not ok for us to treat &mut &'a T as a subtype of &mut &'b T, therefore we can say that &mut T is invariant over T

Here is a table of some other generic types and their variances:

'a	T	U
&'a T	covariant	covariant	
&'a mut T	covariant	invariant	
Box<T>		covariant	
Vec<T>		covariant	
UnsafeCell<T>		invariant	
Cell<T>		invariant	
fn(T) -> U		contravariant	covariant
*const T		covariant	
*mut T		invariant	
Some of these can be explained simply in relation to the others:

Vec<T> and all other owning pointers and collections follow the same logic as Box<T>
Cell<T> and all other interior mutability types follow the same logic as UnsafeCell<T>
UnsafeCell<T> having interior mutability gives it the same variance properties as &mut T
*const T follows the logic of &T
*mut T follows the logic of &mut T (or UnsafeCell<T>)
For more types, see the "Variance" section on the reference.

NOTE: the only source of contravariance in the language is the arguments to a function, which is why it really doesn't come up much in practice. Invoking contravariance involves higher-order programming with function pointers that take references with specific lifetimes (as opposed to the usual "any lifetime", which gets into higher rank lifetimes, which work independently of subtyping).

Now that we have some more formal understanding of variance, let's go through some more examples in more detail.

fn assign<T>(input: &mut T, val: T) {
    *input = val;
}

fn main() {
    let mut hello: &'static str = "hello";
    {
        let world = String::from("world");
        assign(&mut hello, &world);
    }
    println!("{hello}");
}
And what do we get when we run this?

error[E0597]: `world` does not live long enough
  --> src/main.rs:9:28
   |
6  |     let mut hello: &'static str = "hello";
   |                    ------------ type annotation requires that `world` is borrowed for `'static`

10 |     }
   |     - `world` dropped here while still borrowed
Good, it doesn't compile! Let's break down what's happening here in detail.

First let's look at the assign function:

fn assign<T>(input: &mut T, val: T) {
    *input = val;
}
All it does is take a mutable reference and a value and overwrite the referent with it. What's important about this function is that it creates a type equality constraint. It clearly says in its signature the referent and the value must be the exact same type.

Meanwhile, in the caller we pass in &mut &'static str and &'world str.

Because &mut T is invariant over T, the compiler concludes it can't apply any subtyping to the first argument, and so T must be exactly &'static str.

This is counter to the &T case:

fn debug<T: std::fmt::Debug>(a: T, b: T) {
    println!("a = {a:?} b = {b:?}");
}
where similarly a and b must have the same type T. But since &'a T is covariant over 'a, we are allowed to perform subtyping. So the compiler decides that &'static str can become &'b str if and only if &'static str is a subtype of &'b str, which will hold if 'static <: 'b. This is true, so the compiler is happy to continue compiling this code.

As it turns out, the argument for why it's ok for Box (and Vec, HashMap, etc.) to be covariant is pretty similar to the argument for why it's ok for lifetimes to be covariant: as soon as you try to stuff them in something like a mutable reference, they inherit invariance and you're prevented from doing anything bad.

However Box makes it easier to focus on the by-value aspect of references that we partially glossed over.

Unlike a lot of languages which allow values to be freely aliased at all times, Rust has a very strict rule: if you're allowed to mutate or move a value, you are guaranteed to be the only one with access to it.

Consider the following code:

let hello: Box<&'static str> = Box::new("hello");

let mut world: Box<&'b str>;
world = hello;
There is no problem at all with the fact that we have forgotten that hello was alive for 'static, because as soon as we moved hello to a variable that only knew it was alive for 'b, we destroyed the only thing in the universe that remembered it lived for longer!

Only one thing left to explain: function pointers.

To see why fn(T) -> U should be covariant over U, consider the following signature:

fn get_str() -> &'a str;
This function claims to produce a str bound by some lifetime 'a. As such, it is perfectly valid to provide a function with the following signature instead:

fn get_static() -> &'static str;
So when the function is called, all it's expecting is a &str which lives at least the lifetime of 'a, it doesn't matter if the value actually lives longer.

However, the same logic does not apply to arguments. Consider trying to satisfy:

fn store_ref(&'a str);
with:

fn store_static(&'static str);
The first function can accept any string reference as long as it lives at least for 'a, but the second cannot accept a string reference that lives for any duration less than 'static, which would cause a conflict. Covariance doesn't work here. But if we flip it around, it actually does work! If we need a function that can handle &'static str, a function that can handle any reference lifetime will surely work fine.

Let's see this in practice

thread_local! {
    pub static StaticVecs: RefCell<Vec<&'static str>> = RefCell::new(Vec::new());
}

/// saves the input given into a thread local `Vec<&'static str>`
fn store(input: &'static str) {
    StaticVecs.with_borrow_mut(|v| v.push(input));
}

/// Calls the function with it's input (must have the same lifetime!)
fn demo<'a>(input: &'a str, f: fn(&'a str)) {
    f(input);
}

fn main() {
    demo("hello", store); // "hello" is 'static. Can call `store` fine

    {
        let smuggle = String::from("smuggle");

        // `&smuggle` is not static. If we were to call `store` with `&smuggle`,
        // we would have pushed an invalid lifetime into the `StaticVecs`.
        // Therefore, `fn(&'static str)` cannot be a subtype of `fn(&'a str)`
        demo(&smuggle, store);
    }

    // use after free 😿
    StaticVecs.with_borrow(|v| println!("{v:?}"));
}
And that's why function types, unlike anything else in the language, are contravariant over their arguments.

Now, this is all well and good for the types the standard library provides, but how is variance determined for types that you define? A struct, informally speaking, inherits the variance of its fields. If a struct MyType has a generic argument A that is used in a field a, then MyType's variance over A is exactly a's variance over A.

However if A is used in multiple fields:

If all uses of A are covariant, then MyType is covariant over A
If all uses of A are contravariant, then MyType is contravariant over A
Otherwise, MyType is invariant over A
use std::cell::Cell;

struct MyType<'a, 'b, A: 'a, B: 'b, C, D, E, F, G, H, In, Out, Mixed> {
    a: &'a A,     // covariant over 'a and A
    b: &'b mut B, // covariant over 'b and invariant over B

    c: *const C,  // covariant over C
    d: *mut D,    // invariant over D

    e: E,         // covariant over E
    f: Vec<F>,    // covariant over F
    g: Cell<G>,   // invariant over G

    h1: H,        // would also be covariant over H except...
    h2: Cell<H>,  // invariant over H, because invariance wins all conflicts

    i: fn(In) -> Out,       // contravariant over In, covariant over Out

    k1: fn(Mixed) -> usize, // would be contravariant over Mixed except..
    k2: Mixed,              // invariant over Mixed, because invariance wins all conflicts
}
## Drop Check

We have seen how lifetimes provide us some fairly simple rules for ensuring that we never read dangling references. However up to this point we have only ever interacted with the outlives relationship in an inclusive manner. That is, when we talked about 'a: 'b, it was ok for 'a to live exactly as long as 'b. At first glance, this seems to be a meaningless distinction. Nothing ever gets dropped at the same time as another, right? This is why we used the following desugaring of let statements:

let x;
let y;
desugaring to:

{
    let x;
    {
        let y;
    }
}
There are some more complex situations which are not possible to desugar using scopes, but the order is still defined ‒ variables are dropped in the reverse order of their definition, fields of structs and tuples in order of their definition. There are some more details about order of drop in RFC 1857.

Let's do this:

let tuple = (vec![], vec![]);
The left vector is dropped first. But does it mean the right one strictly outlives it in the eyes of the borrow checker? The answer to this question is no. The borrow checker could track fields of tuples separately, but it would still be unable to decide what outlives what in case of vector elements, which are dropped manually via pure-library code the borrow checker doesn't understand.

So why do we care? We care because if the type system isn't careful, it could accidentally make dangling pointers. Consider the following simple program:

struct Inspector<'a>(&'a u8);

struct World<'a> {
    inspector: Option<Inspector<'a>>,
    days: Box<u8>,
}

fn main() {
    let mut world = World {
        inspector: None,
        days: Box::new(1),
    };
    world.inspector = Some(Inspector(&world.days));
}
This program is totally sound and compiles today. The fact that days does not strictly outlive inspector doesn't matter. As long as the inspector is alive, so is days.

However if we add a destructor, the program will no longer compile!

struct Inspector<'a>(&'a u8);

impl<'a> Drop for Inspector<'a> {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        println!("I was only {} days from retirement!", self.0);
    }
}

struct World<'a> {
    inspector: Option<Inspector<'a>>,
    days: Box<u8>,
}

fn main() {
    let mut world = World {
        inspector: None,
        days: Box::new(1),
    };
    world.inspector = Some(Inspector(&world.days));
    // Let's say `days` happens to get dropped first.
    // Then when Inspector is dropped, it will try to read free'd memory!
}
error[E0597]: `world.days` does not live long enough
  --> src/main.rs:19:38
   |
19 |     world.inspector = Some(Inspector(&world.days));

22 | }
   | -
   | |
   | `world.days` dropped here while still borrowed
   | borrow might be used here, when `world` is dropped and runs the destructor for type `World<'_>`
You can try changing the order of fields or use a tuple instead of the struct, it'll still not compile.

Implementing Drop lets the Inspector execute some arbitrary code during its death. This means it can potentially observe that types that are supposed to live as long as it does actually were destroyed first.

Interestingly, only generic types need to worry about this. If they aren't generic, then the only lifetimes they can harbor are 'static, which will truly live forever. This is why this problem is referred to as sound generic drop. Sound generic drop is enforced by the drop checker. As of this writing, some of the finer details of how the drop checker (also called dropck) validates types is totally up in the air. However The Big Rule is the subtlety that we have focused on this whole section:

For a generic type to soundly implement drop, its generics arguments must strictly outlive it.

Obeying this rule is (usually) necessary to satisfy the borrow checker; obeying it is sufficient but not necessary to be sound. That is, if your type obeys this rule then it's definitely sound to drop.

The reason that it is not always necessary to satisfy the above rule is that some Drop implementations will not access borrowed data even though their type gives them the capability for such access, or because we know the specific drop order and the borrowed data is still fine even if the borrow checker doesn't know that.

For example, this variant of the above Inspector example will never access borrowed data:

struct Inspector<'a>(&'a u8, &'static str);

impl<'a> Drop for Inspector<'a> {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        println!("Inspector(_, {}) knows when *not* to inspect.", self.1);
    }
}

struct World<'a> {
    inspector: Option<Inspector<'a>>,
    days: Box<u8>,
}

fn main() {
    let mut world = World {
        inspector: None,
        days: Box::new(1),
    };
    world.inspector = Some(Inspector(&world.days, "gadget"));
    // Let's say `days` happens to get dropped first.
    // Even when Inspector is dropped, its destructor will not access the
    // borrowed `days`.
}
Likewise, this variant will also never access borrowed data:

struct Inspector<T>(T, &'static str);

impl<T> Drop for Inspector<T> {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        println!("Inspector(_, {}) knows when *not* to inspect.", self.1);
    }
}

struct World<T> {
    inspector: Option<Inspector<T>>,
    days: Box<u8>,
}

fn main() {
    let mut world = World {
        inspector: None,
        days: Box::new(1),
    };
    world.inspector = Some(Inspector(&world.days, "gadget"));
    // Let's say `days` happens to get dropped first.
    // Even when Inspector is dropped, its destructor will not access the
    // borrowed `days`.
}
However, both of the above variants are rejected by the borrow checker during the analysis of fn main, saying that days does not live long enough.

The reason is that the borrow checking analysis of main does not know about the internals of each Inspector's Drop implementation. As far as the borrow checker knows while it is analyzing main, the body of an inspector's destructor might access that borrowed data.

Therefore, the drop checker forces all borrowed data in a value to strictly outlive that value.

An Escape Hatch

The precise rules that govern drop checking may be less restrictive in the future.

The current analysis is deliberately conservative and trivial; it forces all borrowed data in a value to outlive that value, which is certainly sound.

Future versions of the language may make the analysis more precise, to reduce the number of cases where sound code is rejected as unsafe. This would help address cases such as the two Inspectors above that know not to inspect during destruction.

In the meantime, there is an unstable attribute that one can use to assert (unsafely) that a generic type's destructor is guaranteed to not access any expired data, even if its type gives it the capability to do so.

That attribute is called may_dangle and was introduced in RFC 1327. To deploy it on the Inspector from above, we would write:

#![feature(dropck_eyepatch)]

struct Inspector<'a>(&'a u8, &'static str);

unsafe impl<#[may_dangle] 'a> Drop for Inspector<'a> {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        println!("Inspector(_, {}) knows when *not* to inspect.", self.1);
    }
}

struct World<'a> {
    days: Box<u8>,
    inspector: Option<Inspector<'a>>,
}

fn main() {
    let mut world = World {
        inspector: None,
        days: Box::new(1),
    };
    world.inspector = Some(Inspector(&world.days, "gadget"));
}
Use of this attribute requires the Drop impl to be marked unsafe because the compiler is not checking the implicit assertion that no potentially expired data (e.g. self.0 above) is accessed.

The attribute can be applied to any number of lifetime and type parameters. In the following example, we assert that we access no data behind a reference of lifetime 'b and that the only uses of T will be moves or drops, but omit the attribute from 'a and U, because we do access data with that lifetime and that type:

#![feature(dropck_eyepatch)]
use std::fmt::Display;

struct Inspector<'a, 'b, T, U: Display>(&'a u8, &'b u8, T, U);

unsafe impl<'a, #[may_dangle] 'b, #[may_dangle] T, U: Display> Drop for Inspector<'a, 'b, T, U> {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        println!("Inspector({}, _, _, {})", self.0, self.3);
    }
}
It is sometimes obvious that no such access can occur, like the case above. However, when dealing with a generic type parameter, such access can occur indirectly. Examples of such indirect access are:

invoking a callback,
via a trait method call.
(Future changes to the language, such as impl specialization, may add other avenues for such indirect access.)

Here is an example of invoking a callback:

struct Inspector<T>(T, &'static str, Box<for <'r> fn(&'r T) -> String>);

impl<T> Drop for Inspector<T> {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        // The `self.2` call could access a borrow e.g. if `T` is `&'a _`.
        println!("Inspector({}, {}) unwittingly inspects expired data.",
                 (self.2)(&self.0), self.1);
    }
}
Here is an example of a trait method call:

use std::fmt;

struct Inspector<T: fmt::Display>(T, &'static str);

impl<T: fmt::Display> Drop for Inspector<T> {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        // There is a hidden call to `<T as Display>::fmt` below, which
        // could access a borrow e.g. if `T` is `&'a _`
        println!("Inspector({}, {}) unwittingly inspects expired data.",
                 self.0, self.1);
    }
}
And of course, all of these accesses could be further hidden within some other method invoked by the destructor, rather than being written directly within it.

In all of the above cases where the &'a u8 is accessed in the destructor, adding the #[may_dangle] attribute makes the type vulnerable to misuse that the borrow checker will not catch, inviting havoc. It is better to avoid adding the attribute.

A related side note about drop order

While the drop order of fields inside a struct is defined, relying on it is fragile and subtle. When the order matters, it is better to use the ManuallyDrop wrapper.

Is that all about drop checker?

It turns out that when writing unsafe code, we generally don't need to worry at all about doing the right thing for the drop checker. However there is one special case that you need to worry about, which we will look at in the next section.

## PhantomData

When working with unsafe code, we can often end up in a situation where types or lifetimes are logically associated with a struct, but not actually part of a field. This most commonly occurs with lifetimes. For instance, the Iter for &'a [T] is (approximately) defined as follows:

struct Iter<'a, T: 'a> {
    ptr: *const T,
    end: *const T,
}
However because 'a is unused within the struct's body, it's unbounded. Because of the troubles this has historically caused, unbounded lifetimes and types are forbidden in struct definitions. Therefore we must somehow refer to these types in the body. Correctly doing this is necessary to have correct variance and drop checking.

We do this using PhantomData, which is a special marker type. PhantomData consumes no space, but simulates a field of the given type for the purpose of static analysis. This was deemed to be less error-prone than explicitly telling the type-system the kind of variance that you want, while also providing other useful things such as auto traits and the information needed by drop check.

Iter logically contains a bunch of &'a Ts, so this is exactly what we tell the PhantomData to simulate:

use std::marker;

struct Iter<'a, T: 'a> {
    ptr: *const T,
    end: *const T,
    _marker: marker::PhantomData<&'a T>,
}
and that's it. The lifetime will be bounded, and your iterator will be covariant over 'a and T. Everything Just Works.

Generic parameters and drop-checking

In the past, there used to be another thing to take into consideration.

This very documentation used to say:

Another important example is Vec, which is (approximately) defined as follows:

struct Vec<T> {
    data: *const T, // *const for variance!
    len: usize,
    cap: usize,
}
Unlike the previous example, it appears that everything is exactly as we want. Every generic argument to Vec shows up in at least one field. Good to go!

Nope.

The drop checker will generously determine that Vec<T> does not own any values of type T. This will in turn make it conclude that it doesn't need to worry about Vec dropping any T's in its destructor for determining drop check soundness. This will in turn allow people to create unsoundness using Vec's destructor.

In order to tell the drop checker that we do own values of type T, and therefore may drop some T's when we drop, we must add an extra PhantomData saying exactly that:

use std::marker;

struct Vec<T> {
    data: *const T, // *const for variance!
    len: usize,
    cap: usize,
    _owns_T: marker::PhantomData<T>,
}
But ever since RFC 1238, this is no longer true nor necessary.

If you were to write:

struct Vec<T> {
    data: *const T, // `*const` for variance!
    len: usize,
    cap: usize,
}

impl<T> Drop for Vec<T> { /* … */ }
then the existence of that impl<T> Drop for Vec<T> makes it so Rust will consider that that Vec<T> owns values of type T (more precisely: may use values of type T in its Drop implementation), and Rust will thus not allow them to dangle should a Vec<T> be dropped.

When a type already has a Drop impl, adding an extra _owns_T: PhantomData<T> field is thus superfluous and accomplishes nothing, dropck-wise (it still affects variance and auto-traits).

(advanced edge case: if the type containing the PhantomData has no Drop impl at all, but still has drop glue (by having another field with drop glue), then the dropck/#[may_dangle] considerations mentioned herein do apply as well: a PhantomData<T> field will then require T to be droppable whenever the containing type goes out of scope).
But this situation can sometimes lead to overly restrictive code. That's why the standard library uses an unstable and unsafe attribute to opt back into the old "unchecked" drop-checking behavior, that this very documentation warned about: the #[may_dangle] attribute.

An exception: the special case of the standard library and its unstable #[may_dangle]

This section can be skipped if you are only writing your own library code; but if you are curious about what the standard library does with the actual Vec definition, you'll notice that it still needs to use a _owns_T: PhantomData<T> field for soundness.

Click here to see why
Raw pointers that own an allocation is such a pervasive pattern that the standard library made a utility for itself called Unique<T> which:

wraps a *const T for variance
includes a PhantomData<T>
auto-derives Send/Sync as if T was contained
marks the pointer as NonZero for the null-pointer optimization
Table of PhantomData patterns

Here’s a table of all the wonderful ways PhantomData could be used:

Phantom type	variance of 'a	variance of T	Send/Sync
(or lack thereof)	dangling 'a or T in drop glue
(e.g., #[may_dangle] Drop)
PhantomData<T>	-	covariant	inherited	disallowed ("owns T")
PhantomData<&'a T>	covariant	covariant	Send + Sync
requires
T : Sync	allowed
PhantomData<&'a mut T>	covariant	invariant	inherited	allowed
PhantomData<*const T>	-	covariant	!Send + !Sync	allowed
PhantomData<*mut T>	-	invariant	!Send + !Sync	allowed
PhantomData<fn(T)>	-	contravariant	Send + Sync	allowed
PhantomData<fn() -> T>	-	covariant	Send + Sync	allowed
PhantomData<fn(T) -> T>	-	invariant	Send + Sync	allowed
PhantomData<Cell<&'a ()>>	invariant	-	Send + !Sync	allowed
Note: opting out of the Unpin auto-trait requires the dedicated PhantomPinned type instead.
## Splitting Borrows

The mutual exclusion property of mutable references can be very limiting when working with a composite structure. The borrow checker (a.k.a. borrowck) understands some basic stuff, but will fall over pretty easily. It does understand structs sufficiently to know that it's possible to borrow disjoint fields of a struct simultaneously. So this works today:

struct Foo {
    a: i32,
    b: i32,
    c: i32,
}

let mut x = Foo {a: 0, b: 0, c: 0};
let a = &mut x.a;
let b = &mut x.b;
let c = &x.c;
*b += 1;
let c2 = &x.c;
*a += 10;
println!("{} {} {} {}", a, b, c, c2);
However borrowck doesn't understand arrays or slices in any way, so this doesn't work:

let mut x = [1, 2, 3];
let a = &mut x[0];
let b = &mut x[1];
println!("{} {}", a, b);
error[E0499]: cannot borrow `x[..]` as mutable more than once at a time
 --> src/lib.rs:4:18
  |
3 |     let a = &mut x[0];
  |                  ---- first mutable borrow occurs here
4 |     let b = &mut x[1];
  |                  ^^^^ second mutable borrow occurs here
5 |     println!("{} {}", a, b);
6 | }
  | - first borrow ends here

error: aborting due to previous error
While it was plausible that borrowck could understand this simple case, it's pretty clearly hopeless for borrowck to understand disjointness in general container types like a tree, especially if distinct keys actually do map to the same value.

In order to "teach" borrowck that what we're doing is ok, we need to drop down to unsafe code. For instance, mutable slices expose a split_at_mut function that consumes the slice and returns two mutable slices. One for everything to the left of the index, and one for everything to the right. Intuitively we know this is safe because the slices don't overlap, and therefore alias. However the implementation requires some unsafety:

pub fn split_at_mut(&mut self, mid: usize) -> (&mut [T], &mut [T]) {
    let len = self.len();
    let ptr = self.as_mut_ptr();

    unsafe {
        assert!(mid <= len);

        (from_raw_parts_mut(ptr, mid),
         from_raw_parts_mut(ptr.add(mid), len - mid))
    }
}
This is actually a bit subtle. So as to avoid ever making two &mut's to the same value, we explicitly construct brand-new slices through raw pointers.

However more subtle is how iterators that yield mutable references work. The iterator trait is defined as follows:

trait Iterator {
    type Item;

    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item>;
}
Given this definition, Self::Item has no connection to self. This means that we can call next several times in a row, and hold onto all the results concurrently. This is perfectly fine for by-value iterators, which have exactly these semantics. It's also actually fine for shared references, as they admit arbitrarily many references to the same thing (although the iterator needs to be a separate object from the thing being shared).

But mutable references make this a mess. At first glance, they might seem completely incompatible with this API, as it would produce multiple mutable references to the same object!

However it actually does work, exactly because iterators are one-shot objects. Everything an IterMut yields will be yielded at most once, so we don't actually ever yield multiple mutable references to the same piece of data.

Perhaps surprisingly, mutable iterators don't require unsafe code to be implemented for many types!

For instance here's a singly linked list:

type Link<T> = Option<Box<Node<T>>>;

struct Node<T> {
    elem: T,
    next: Link<T>,
}

pub struct LinkedList<T> {
    head: Link<T>,
}

pub struct IterMut<'a, T: 'a>(Option<&'a mut Node<T>>);

impl<T> LinkedList<T> {
    fn iter_mut(&mut self) -> IterMut<T> {
        IterMut(self.head.as_mut().map(|node| &mut **node))
    }
}

impl<'a, T> Iterator for IterMut<'a, T> {
    type Item = &'a mut T;

    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item> {
        self.0.take().map(|node| {
            self.0 = node.next.as_mut().map(|node| &mut **node);
            &mut node.elem
        })
    }
}
Here's a mutable slice:

use std::mem;

pub struct IterMut<'a, T: 'a>(&'a mut[T]);

impl<'a, T> Iterator for IterMut<'a, T> {
    type Item = &'a mut T;

    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item> {
        let slice = mem::take(&mut self.0);
        if slice.is_empty() { return None; }

        let (l, r) = slice.split_at_mut(1);
        self.0 = r;
        l.get_mut(0)
    }
}

impl<'a, T> DoubleEndedIterator for IterMut<'a, T> {
    fn next_back(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item> {
        let slice = mem::take(&mut self.0);
        if slice.is_empty() { return None; }

        let new_len = slice.len() - 1;
        let (l, r) = slice.split_at_mut(new_len);
        self.0 = l;
        r.get_mut(0)
    }
}
And here's a binary tree:

use std::collections::VecDeque;

type Link<T> = Option<Box<Node<T>>>;

struct Node<T> {
    elem: T,
    left: Link<T>,
    right: Link<T>,
}

pub struct Tree<T> {
    root: Link<T>,
}

struct NodeIterMut<'a, T: 'a> {
    elem: Option<&'a mut T>,
    left: Option<&'a mut Node<T>>,
    right: Option<&'a mut Node<T>>,
}

enum State<'a, T: 'a> {
    Elem(&'a mut T),
    Node(&'a mut Node<T>),
}

pub struct IterMut<'a, T: 'a>(VecDeque<NodeIterMut<'a, T>>);

impl<T> Tree<T> {
    pub fn iter_mut(&mut self) -> IterMut<T> {
        let mut deque = VecDeque::new();
        if let Some(root) = self.root.as_mut() {
            deque.push_front(root.iter_mut());
        }
        IterMut(deque)
    }
}

impl<T> Node<T> {
    pub fn iter_mut(&mut self) -> NodeIterMut<T> {
        NodeIterMut {
            elem: Some(&mut self.elem),
            left: self.left.as_deref_mut(),
            right: self.right.as_deref_mut(),
        }
    }
}

impl<'a, T> Iterator for NodeIterMut<'a, T> {
    type Item = State<'a, T>;

    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item> {
        self.left.take().map(State::Node).or_else(|| {
            self.elem
                .take()
                .map(State::Elem)
                .or_else(|| self.right.take().map(State::Node))
        })
    }
}

impl<'a, T> DoubleEndedIterator for NodeIterMut<'a, T> {
    fn next_back(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item> {
        self.right.take().map(State::Node).or_else(|| {
            self.elem
                .take()
                .map(State::Elem)
                .or_else(|| self.left.take().map(State::Node))
        })
    }
}

impl<'a, T> Iterator for IterMut<'a, T> {
    type Item = &'a mut T;
    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item> {
        loop {
            match self.0.front_mut().and_then(Iterator::next) {
                Some(State::Elem(elem)) => return Some(elem),
                Some(State::Node(node)) => self.0.push_front(node.iter_mut()),
                None => {
                    self.0.pop_front()?;
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

impl<'a, T> DoubleEndedIterator for IterMut<'a, T> {
    fn next_back(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item> {
        loop {
            match self.0.back_mut().and_then(DoubleEndedIterator::next_back) {
                Some(State::Elem(elem)) => return Some(elem),
                Some(State::Node(node)) => self.0.push_back(node.iter_mut()),
                None => {
                    self.0.pop_back()?;
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
All of these are completely safe and work on stable Rust! This ultimately falls out of the simple struct case we saw before: Rust understands that you can safely split a mutable reference into subfields. We can then encode permanently consuming a reference via Options (or in the case of slices, replacing with an empty slice).

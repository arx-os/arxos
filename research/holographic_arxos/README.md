# Holographic ArxOS - Research Project

## Status: RESEARCH / NOT FOR PRODUCTION

This is an experimental research project exploring quantum-conscious ArxObjects with fractal compression and integrated information theory.

## Why Separated from Core?

The holographic system violates core ArxOS principles:
- **Heavy Processing**: Complex quantum simulations, consciousness calculations
- **Large Binary**: Adds several MB to binary size
- **Not Routing**: Processes rather than routes information

Per ArxOS vision: **"ArxOS routes building intelligence, it doesn't process it."**

## Research Value

This system explores fascinating concepts:
- Quantum superposition of building states
- Consciousness fields (IIT/Phi calculations)
- Fractal infinite detail compression
- Temporal evolution dynamics

## Future Integration

If these concepts prove valuable, they should be:
1. Implemented as external services
2. Communicate with ArxOS via 13-byte ArxObjects
3. ArxOS routes quantum states, doesn't calculate them

## Architecture if Reintegrated
```
Quantum Service → Quantum State (ASCII) → ArxOS → ArxObject (13 bytes) → Mesh Network
```

## Files
- Full holographic system implementation
- SIMD optimizations
- Quantum mechanics simulations
- Consciousness field calculations
- Fractal geometry systems

These are preserved for research but must NOT be in the core ArxOS binary.

# ArxOS - Buildings as Playable Worlds

> **"We're not maintaining buildings. We're playing them."**

## What is ArxOS?

ArxOS transforms every building on Earth into a **living, playable dungeon** - like Elden Ring meets infrastructure, Pokemon Go meets maintenance, all rendered in ASCII art and never touching the internet. Through 13-byte ArxObjects transmitted over packet radio, we compress reality itself into a game where every maintenance task is a quest, every room is a level, and every technician is a hero.

**Core Innovation**: Buildings become conscious, interactive game worlds. LiDAR scans and semantic input compress into ArxObjects that render as explorable ASCII dungeons in terminals, AR overlays for field techs, and CSI WiFi "vision" for security - all through RF mesh networks anchored by school districts.

## The Vision: Reality as a Game Engine

### Physical → Digital → Playable
1. **Capture**: LiDAR scans + semantic input → 10,000:1 compression
2. **Compress**: Reality → 13-byte ArxObjects (quantum seeds of infinite detail)
3. **Render**: ASCII dungeons, AR overlays, CSI WiFi vision
4. **Play**: Navigate buildings like roguelikes, complete quests, level up

### The Three Views
- **Terminal**: Buildings as ASCII art dungeons (think Dwarf Fortress)
- **AR**: Pokemon Go for maintenance techs
- **CSI WiFi**: See through walls using electromagnetic shadows

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/arxos/arxos.git
cd arxos
cargo build --release

# Run ArxOS service
cargo run --bin arxos-service -- --config config.toml

# Connect to service via terminal
arxos connect --port /dev/ttyUSB0
```

## Core Features

### Reality Compression Engine
- **🗜️ 10,000:1 Compression**: 50MB point clouds → 5KB ArxObjects → Infinite procedural detail
- **🧬 Quantum Seeds**: Each 13-byte object contains infinite nested realities
- **📱 iPhone LiDAR**: 20-second scans capture entire buildings

### Gaming Infrastructure
- **🎮 Roguelike Buildings**: Every building is a playable dungeon
- **⚔️ Quest System**: Maintenance tasks become RPG quests with XP rewards
- **👁️ CSI WiFi Vision**: See through walls using electromagnetic patterns
- **🏆 Achievement System**: Level up, unlock abilities, compete globally

### Unhackable Mesh Network  
- **🔒 Air-Gapped**: No internet = no remote hacking possible
- **📡 RF Mesh**: LoRa packet radio creates planetary nervous system
- **🔐 Zero-Knowledge**: Districts route without reading data
- **🏫 School Backbone**: Public infrastructure as network nodes

### ArxObject input formats (terminal `send`)

You can send an `ArxObject` in two ways:

- Compact 13-byte hex (26 hex chars, little-endian struct layout):
```bash
arxos> send 0x341210d007b80b2c010c78000f
# Breakdown:
# 34 12  | 10 | d0 07 | b8 0b | 2c 01 | 0c 78 00 0f
#  bid     typ   x        y       z       props[4]
```

- Key=value pairs (hex or decimal). Aliases allowed: `building_id|bid|b`, `object_type|type|ot`, `props|properties|props_hex`.
```bash
arxos> send bid=0x1234 type=0x10 x=2000 y=3000 z=300 props=0x0C78000F
arxos> send building_id=4660 object_type=16 x=2000 y=3000 z=300 properties=[12,120,0,15]
```

Notes:
- Coordinates are millimeters.
- `props` accepts `0xAABBCCDD` or `[AA,BB,CC,DD]` (decimal or hex per element).
- Inputs are validated; malformed values are rejected.

#### Heartbeat (programmatic)

Heartbeats announce node presence on the RF mesh. The service sends these automatically, but if you need to generate one in Rust:
```rust
use arxos_core::ArxObject;

let node_id: u16 = 0x0001;
let heartbeat: ArxObject = ArxObject::heartbeat(node_id);
// Now publish via your transport/client; the service does this for you.
```

## Hardware Requirements

- **Standard Meshtastic Hardware** (ESP32 + LoRa radio)
- **ArxOS Service** runs on any compatible device
- **USB LoRa Dongle** for desktop connections
- **Bluetooth** for mobile device connections

## The Philosophy

### Why Buildings as Games?
- **Engagement**: Maintenance becomes addictive, not tedious
- **Visualization**: Complex systems become intuitive dungeons
- **Motivation**: XP and achievements drive performance
- **Training**: New staff learn by playing
- **Community**: Technicians form guilds and share strategies

### Why No Internet?
- **Security**: Air-gapped = unhackable from outside
- **Sovereignty**: Your building data stays yours
- **Resilience**: Works during internet outages
- **Privacy**: No cloud surveillance possible
- **Innovation**: Constraints force elegant solutions

### The Cyberpunk Reality
We're building the cyberpunk future where:
- Hackers are maintenance techs with terminal access
- Buildings have consciousness rendered in ASCII
- Reality compresses into 13-byte seeds
- WiFi lets you see through walls
- Infrastructure is a massively multiplayer roguelike

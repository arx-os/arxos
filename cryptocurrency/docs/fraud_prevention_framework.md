# ARX Fraud Prevention Framework
### Version 1.0 — July 21, 2025

---

## 🛡️ Purpose

To ensure the integrity, fairness, and trustworthiness of the ARX token and the broader Arxos ecosystem by mitigating fraudulent behavior during token minting, data submission, and dividend participation.

---

## 🧱 Categories of Fraud Risk

| Type                 | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| Fake Contributions   | Low-quality or fabricated markups submitted to mint ARX |
| Simulation Abuse     | Uploading buildings with non-functional systems to farm ARX |
| Dividend Farming     | Accumulating ARX dishonestly to receive yield |
| Sybil Attacks        | Creating fake accounts to mint more ARX or manipulate governance |
| Data Resubmission    | Reuploading existing or plagiarized contributions |
| Contract Forgery     | Pretending to be a legitimate engineer or facilities team |

---

## 🔐 10-Layer Defense System

### 1. AI + Rule-Based Verification
All contributions are run through ArxLogic and simulation validation:
- Detects invalid object connections
- Flags illogical behavior profiles
- Dedupe scans

---

### 2. Secondary User Verification
- Required for all contributions to proceed with minting
- Secondary user must verify the object is valid and useful
- Adds social consensus layer

---

### 3. Contributor Reputation Engine
- Contributors build a reputation score from:
  - Accuracy rate
  - Reuse yield
  - Simulation pass %
- Low score = limited minting, higher scrutiny

---

### 4. KYC for Institutions
- Uploads from facility managers or architects require:
  - Identity verification
  - Legal entity confirmation (optional, tier-based)

---

### 5. Hashing + Fingerprinting
- All contributions are hashed
- Prevents duplicate uploads
- Ties every markup to original wallet

---

### 6. Escrowed Minting Delay
- Minted ARX is time-locked for 3–7 days
- Allows for audits, AI recheck, peer reports
- Prevents fast-farm-exit abuse

---

### 7. Transparent Audit Trail
- All minting events are public:
  - Contributor address
  - Contribution type
  - ARX earned
- Enables public monitoring of large mint events

---

### 8. Diminishing Mint Curves
- Minting rates reduce for low-complexity spammed objects
- Curve favors reusable, simulation-capable contributions

---

### 9. Real-World Logic Oracles
- Cross-check contributions with building standards:
  - Code compliance
  - Equipment ratios
  - System design norms
- Flags impossible configurations

---

### 10. Slashing and Blacklisting
- Verified fraud results in:
  - Contribution invalidation
  - ARX burn from wallet
  - Wallet ban or contribution ban

---

## 🧱 Verification System

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Primary Verification | AI validation using ArxLogic |
| Secondary Verification | User verification required for all contributions |
| Fraud Detection | AI + rule-based checks |
| Reputation System | Contributor reputation tracking |

---

## 🧠 Guiding Philosophy

Fraud protection is enforced through:
- AI + Simulation intelligence
- Social validation and public auditability
- Contributor identity and quality tracking
- Real-world engineering logic and standards

> ARX must remain the most trusted work-minted, yield-bearing infrastructure token on Earth.

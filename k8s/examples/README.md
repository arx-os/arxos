# Kubernetes Examples

This directory will host example manifests demonstrating how to run ArxOS on Kubernetes once the operator and CRDs are implemented.

Planned examples:
- `arxjob-import.yaml` – single CLI job.
- `arxschedule-docs.yaml` – scheduled export.
- `gitops/` – GitOps-ready manifests for ArgoCD/Flux.
- `helm-values.yaml` – sample Helm values file for enterprise deployment.

Documentation reference: `docs/development/K8S_GUIDE.md`.

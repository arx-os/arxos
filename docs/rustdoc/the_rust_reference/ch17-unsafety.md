# Unsafety
[safety.intro]
Unsafe operations are those that can potentially violate the memory-safety guarantees of Rust’s static semantics.
[safety.unsafe-ops]
The following language level features cannot be used in the safe subset of Rust:
[safety.unsafe-deref]
Dereferencing a raw pointer.
[safety.unsafe-static]
Reading or writing a mutable or unsafe external static variable.
[safety.unsafe-union-access]
Accessing a field of a union, other than to assign to it.
[safety.unsafe-call]
Calling an unsafe function.
[safety.unsafe-target-feature-call]
Calling a safe function marked with a target_feature from a function that does not have a target_feature attribute enabling the same features (see attributes.codegen.target_feature.safety-restrictions).
[safety.unsafe-impl]
Implementing an unsafe trait.
[safety.unsafe-extern]
Declaring an extern block1.
[safety.unsafe-attribute]
Applying an unsafe attribute to an item.
Prior to the 2024 edition, extern blocks were allowed to be declared without unsafe. ↩

[unsafe]
## The unsafe keyword

[unsafe.intro]
The unsafe keyword is used to create or discharge the obligation to prove something safe. Specifically:
It is used to mark code that defines extra safety conditions that must be upheld elsewhere.
This includes unsafe fn, unsafe static, and unsafe trait.
It is used to mark code that the programmer asserts satisfies safety conditions defined elsewhere.
This includes unsafe {}, unsafe impl, unsafe fn without unsafe_op_in_unsafe_fn, unsafe extern, and #[unsafe(attr)].
The following discusses each of these cases. See the keyword documentation for some illustrative examples.
[unsafe.positions]
The unsafe keyword can occur in several different contexts:
unsafe functions (unsafe fn)
unsafe blocks (unsafe {})
unsafe traits (unsafe trait)
unsafe trait implementations (unsafe impl)
unsafe external blocks (unsafe extern)
unsafe external statics (unsafe static)
unsafe attributes (#[unsafe(attr)])
[unsafe.fn]
Unsafe functions (unsafe fn)
[unsafe.fn.intro]
Unsafe functions are functions that are not safe in all contexts and/or for all possible inputs. We say they have extra safety conditions, which are requirements that must be upheld by all callers and that the compiler does not check. For example, get_unchecked has the extra safety condition that the index must be in-bounds. The unsafe function should come with documentation explaining what those extra safety conditions are.
[unsafe.fn.safety]
Such a function must be prefixed with the keyword unsafe and can only be called from inside an unsafe block, or inside unsafe fn without the unsafe_op_in_unsafe_fn lint.
[unsafe.block]
Unsafe blocks (unsafe {})
[unsafe.block.intro]
A block of code can be prefixed with the unsafe keyword to permit using the unsafe actions as defined in the Unsafety chapter, such as calling other unsafe functions or dereferencing raw pointers.
[unsafe.block.fn-body]
By default, the body of an unsafe function is also considered to be an unsafe block; this can be changed by enabling the unsafe_op_in_unsafe_fn lint.
By putting operations into an unsafe block, the programmer states that they have taken care of satisfying the extra safety conditions of all operations inside that block.
Unsafe blocks are the logical dual to unsafe functions: where unsafe functions define a proof obligation that callers must uphold, unsafe blocks state that all relevant proof obligations of functions or operations called inside the block have been discharged. There are many ways to discharge proof obligations; for example, there could be run-time checks or data structure invariants that guarantee that certain properties are definitely true, or the unsafe block could be inside an unsafe fn, in which case the block can use the proof obligations of that function to discharge the proof obligations arising inside the block.
Unsafe blocks are used to wrap foreign libraries, make direct use of hardware or implement features not directly present in the language. For example, Rust provides the language features necessary to implement memory-safe concurrency in the language but the implementation of threads and message passing in the standard library uses unsafe blocks.
Rust’s type system is a conservative approximation of the dynamic safety requirements, so in some cases there is a performance cost to using safe code. For example, a doubly-linked list is not a tree structure and can only be represented with reference-counted pointers in safe code. By using unsafe blocks to represent the reverse links as raw pointers, it can be implemented without reference counting. (See “Learn Rust With Entirely Too Many Linked Lists” for a more in-depth exploration of this particular example.)
[unsafe.trait]
Unsafe traits (unsafe trait)
[unsafe.trait.intro]
An unsafe trait is a trait that comes with extra safety conditions that must be upheld by implementations of the trait. The unsafe trait should come with documentation explaining what those extra safety conditions are.
[unsafe.trait.safety]
Such a trait must be prefixed with the keyword unsafe and can only be implemented by unsafe impl blocks.
[unsafe.impl]
Unsafe trait implementations (unsafe impl)
When implementing an unsafe trait, the implementation needs to be prefixed with the unsafe keyword. By writing unsafe impl, the programmer states that they have taken care of satisfying the extra safety conditions required by the trait.
Unsafe trait implementations are the logical dual to unsafe traits: where unsafe traits define a proof obligation that implementations must uphold, unsafe implementations state that all relevant proof obligations have been discharged.
[unsafe.extern]
Unsafe external blocks (unsafe extern)
The programmer who declares an external block must assure that the signatures of the items contained within are correct. Failing to do so may lead to undefined behavior. That this obligation has been met is indicated by writing unsafe extern.
[unsafe.extern.edition2024]
2024
Edition differences

Prior to edition 2024, extern blocks were allowed without being qualified as unsafe.
[unsafe.attribute]
Unsafe attributes (#[unsafe(attr)])
An unsafe attribute is one that has extra safety conditions that must be upheld when using the attribute. The compiler cannot check whether these conditions have been upheld. To assert that they have been, these attributes must be wrapped in unsafe(..), e.g. #[unsafe(no_mangle)].
[undefined]
## Behavior considered undefined

[undefined.general]
Rust code is incorrect if it exhibits any of the behaviors in the following list. This includes code within unsafe blocks and unsafe functions. unsafe only means that avoiding undefined behavior is on the programmer; it does not change anything about the fact that Rust programs must never cause undefined behavior.
[undefined.soundness]
It is the programmer’s responsibility when writing unsafe code to ensure that any safe code interacting with the unsafe code cannot trigger these behaviors. unsafe code that satisfies this property for any safe client is called sound; if unsafe code can be misused by safe code to exhibit undefined behavior, it is unsound.
Warning

The following list is not exhaustive; it may grow or shrink. There is no formal model of Rust’s semantics for what is and is not allowed in unsafe code, so there may be more behavior considered unsafe. We also reserve the right to make some of the behavior in that list defined in the future. In other words, this list does not say that anything will definitely always be undefined in all future Rust version (but we might make such commitments for some list items in the future).

Please read the Rustonomicon before writing unsafe code.
[undefined.race]
Data races.
[undefined.pointer-access]
Accessing (loading from or storing to) a place that is dangling or based on a misaligned pointer.
[undefined.place-projection]
Performing a place projection that violates the requirements of in-bounds pointer arithmetic. A place projection is a field expression, a tuple index expression, or an array/slice index expression.
[undefined.alias]
Breaking the pointer aliasing rules. The exact aliasing rules are not determined yet, but here is an outline of the general principles: &T must point to memory that is not mutated while they are live (except for data inside an UnsafeCell<U>), and &mut T must point to memory that is not read or written by any pointer not derived from the reference and that no other reference points to while they are live. Box<T> is treated similar to &'static mut T for the purpose of these rules. The exact liveness duration is not specified, but some bounds exist:

For references, the liveness duration is upper-bounded by the syntactic lifetime assigned by the borrow checker; it cannot be live any longer than that lifetime.
Each time a reference or box is dereferenced or reborrowed, it is considered live.
Each time a reference or box is passed to or returned from a function, it is considered live.
When a reference (but not a Box!) is passed to a function, it is live at least as long as that function call, again except if the &T contains an UnsafeCell<U>.
All this also applies when values of these types are passed in a (nested) field of a compound type, but not behind pointer indirections.
[undefined.immutable]
Mutating immutable bytes. All bytes reachable through a const-promoted expression are immutable, as well as bytes reachable through borrows in static and const initializers that have been lifetime-extended to 'static. The bytes owned by an immutable binding or immutable static are immutable, unless those bytes are part of an UnsafeCell<U>.

Moreover, the bytes pointed to by a shared reference, including transitively through other references (both shared and mutable) and Boxes, are immutable; transitivity includes those references stored in fields of compound types.

A mutation is any write of more than 0 bytes which overlaps with any of the relevant bytes (even if that write does not change the memory contents).
[undefined.intrinsic]
Invoking undefined behavior via compiler intrinsics.
[undefined.target-feature]
Executing code compiled with platform features that the current platform does not support (see target_feature), except if the platform explicitly documents this to be safe.
[undefined.call]
Calling a function with the wrong call ABI, or unwinding past a stack frame that does not allow unwinding (e.g. by calling a "C-unwind" function imported or transmuted as a "C" function or function pointer).
[undefined.invalid]
Producing an invalid value. “Producing” a value happens any time a value is assigned to or read from a place, passed to a function/primitive operation or returned from a function/primitive operation.
[undefined.asm]
Incorrect use of inline assembly. For more details, refer to the rules to follow when writing code that uses inline assembly.
[undefined.const-transmute-ptr2int]
In const context: transmuting or otherwise reinterpreting a pointer (reference, raw pointer, or function pointer) into some allocation as a non-pointer type (such as integers). ‘Reinterpreting’ refers to loading the pointer value at integer type without a cast, e.g. by doing raw pointer casts or using a union.
[undefined.runtime]
Violating assumptions of the Rust runtime. Most assumptions of the Rust runtime are currently not explicitly documented.
For assumptions specifically related to unwinding, see the panic documentation.
The runtime assumes that a Rust stack frame is not deallocated without executing destructors for local variables owned by the stack frame. This assumption can be violated by C functions like longjmp.
Note

Undefined behavior affects the entire program. For example, calling a function in C that exhibits undefined behavior of C means your entire program contains undefined behaviour that can also affect the Rust code. And vice versa, undefined behavior in Rust can cause adverse affects on code executed by any FFI calls to other languages.
[undefined.pointed-to]
Pointed-to bytes
The span of bytes a pointer or reference “points to” is determined by the pointer value and the size of the pointee type (using size_of_val).
[undefined.misaligned]
Places based on misaligned pointers
[undefined.misaligned.general]
A place is said to be “based on a misaligned pointer” if the last * projection during place computation was performed on a pointer that was not aligned for its type. (If there is no * projection in the place expression, then this is accessing the field of a local or static and rustc will guarantee proper alignment. If there are multiple * projection, then each of them incurs a load of the pointer-to-be-dereferenced itself from memory, and each of these loads is subject to the alignment constraint. Note that some * projections can be omitted in surface Rust syntax due to automatic dereferencing; we are considering the fully expanded place expression here.)
For instance, if ptr has type *const S where S has an alignment of 8, then ptr must be 8-aligned or else (*ptr).f is “based on an misaligned pointer”. This is true even if the type of the field f is u8 (i.e., a type with alignment 1). In other words, the alignment requirement derives from the type of the pointer that was dereferenced, not the type of the field that is being accessed.
[undefined.misaligned.load-store]
Note that a place based on a misaligned pointer only leads to Undefined Behavior when it is loaded from or stored to.
[undefined.misaligned.raw]
&raw const/&raw mut on such a place is allowed.
[undefined.misaligned.reference]
&/&mut on a place requires the alignment of the field type (or else the program would be “producing an invalid value”), which generally is a less restrictive requirement than being based on an aligned pointer.
[undefined.misaligned.packed]
Taking a reference will lead to a compiler error in cases where the field type might be more aligned than the type that contains it, i.e., repr(packed). This means that being based on an aligned pointer is always sufficient to ensure that the new reference is aligned, but it is not always necessary.
[undefined.dangling]
Dangling pointers
[undefined.dangling.general]
A reference/pointer is “dangling” if not all of the bytes it points to are part of the same live allocation (so in particular they all have to be part of some allocation).
[undefined.dangling.zero-size]
If the size is 0, then the pointer is trivially never “dangling” (even if it is a null pointer).
[undefined.dangling.dynamic-size]
Note that dynamically sized types (such as slices and strings) point to their entire range, so it is important that the length metadata is never too large.
[undefined.dangling.alloc-limit]
In particular, the dynamic size of a Rust value (as determined by size_of_val) must never exceed isize::MAX, since it is impossible for a single allocation to be larger than isize::MAX.
[undefined.validity]
Invalid values
[undefined.validity.general]
The Rust compiler assumes that all values produced during program execution are “valid”, and producing an invalid value is hence immediate UB.
Whether a value is valid depends on the type:
[undefined.validity.bool]
A bool value must be false (0) or true (1).
[undefined.validity.fn-pointer]
A fn pointer value must be non-null.
[undefined.validity.char]
A char value must not be a surrogate (i.e., must not be in the range 0xD800..=0xDFFF) and must be equal to or less than char::MAX.
[undefined.validity.never]
A ! value must never exist.
[undefined.validity.scalar]
An integer (i*/u*), floating point value (f*), or raw pointer must be initialized, i.e., must not be obtained from uninitialized memory.
[undefined.validity.str]
A str value is treated like [u8], i.e. it must be initialized.
[undefined.validity.enum]
An enum must have a valid discriminant, and all fields of the variant indicated by that discriminant must be valid at their respective type.
[undefined.validity.struct]
A struct, tuple, and array requires all fields/elements to be valid at their respective type.
[undefined.validity.union]
For a union, the exact validity requirements are not decided yet. Obviously, all values that can be created entirely in safe code are valid. If the union has a zero-sized field, then every possible value is valid. Further details are still being debated.
[undefined.validity.reference-box]
A reference or Box<T> must be aligned and non-null, it cannot be dangling, and it must point to a valid value (in case of dynamically sized types, using the actual dynamic type of the pointee as determined by the metadata). Note that the last point (about pointing to a valid value) remains a subject of some debate.
[undefined.validity.wide]
The metadata of a wide reference, Box<T>, or raw pointer must match the type of the unsized tail:
dyn Trait metadata must be a pointer to a compiler-generated vtable for Trait. (For raw pointers, this requirement remains a subject of some debate.)
Slice ([T]) metadata must be a valid usize. Furthermore, for wide references and Box<T>, slice metadata is invalid if it makes the total size of the pointed-to value bigger than isize::MAX.
[undefined.validity.valid-range]
If a type has a custom range of a valid values, then a valid value must be in that range. In the standard library, this affects NonNull<T> and NonZero<T>.

Note

rustc achieves this with the unstable rustc_layout_scalar_valid_range_* attributes.
[undefined.validity.undef]
Note: Uninitialized memory is also implicitly invalid for any type that has a restricted set of valid values. In other words, the only cases in which reading uninitialized memory is permitted are inside unions and in “padding” (the gaps between the fields of a type).
## Behavior not considered unsafe

The Rust compiler does not consider the following behaviors unsafe, though a programmer may (should) find them undesirable, unexpected, or erroneous.
Deadlocks
Leaks of memory and other resources
Exiting without calling destructors
Exposing randomized base addresses through pointer leaks
Integer overflow
If a program contains arithmetic overflow, the programmer has made an error. In the following discussion, we maintain a distinction between arithmetic overflow and wrapping arithmetic. The first is erroneous, while the second is intentional.
When the programmer has enabled debug_assert! assertions (for example, by enabling a non-optimized build), implementations must insert dynamic checks that panic on overflow. Other kinds of builds may result in panics or silently wrapped values on overflow, at the implementation’s discretion.
In the case of implicitly-wrapped overflow, implementations must provide well-defined (even if still considered erroneous) results by using two’s complement overflow conventions.
The integral types provide inherent methods to allow programmers explicitly to perform wrapping arithmetic. For example, i32::wrapping_add provides two’s complement, wrapping addition.
The standard library also provides a Wrapping<T> newtype which ensures all standard arithmetic operations for T have wrapping semantics.
See RFC 560 for error conditions, rationale, and more details about integer overflow.
Logic errors
Safe code may impose extra logical constraints that can be checked at neither compile-time nor runtime. If a program breaks such a constraint, the behavior may be unspecified but will not result in undefined behavior. This could include panics, incorrect results, aborts, and non-termination. The behavior may also differ between runs, builds, or kinds of build.
For example, implementing both Hash and Eq requires that values considered equal have equal hashes. Another example are data structures like BinaryHeap, BTreeMap, BTreeSet, HashMap and HashSet which describe constraints on the modification of their keys while they are in the data structure. Violating such constraints is not considered unsafe, yet the program is considered erroneous and its behavior unpredictable.

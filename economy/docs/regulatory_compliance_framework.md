# ARX Regulatory Compliance Framework
### Version 2.0 — Enterprise-Grade Implementation

---

## 🧭 Overview
This framework governs the legal, financial, and technical compliance requirements for the ARX token and its integration within the Arxos platform, recognizing ARX as a security under U.S. and international law. It ensures that all minting, transfers, dividends, and public offerings of ARX are conducted transparently and legally.

---

## 🏛️ Legal Entity Structure

### 1.1 Issuer Structure
ARX must be issued by a registered corporate entity or trust, likely a subsidiary of Arxos (e.g., Arxos Financial Instruments Inc.).

This entity is responsible for compliance filings, dividend disbursements, and treasury operations.

### 1.2 Classification
ARX is formally recognized as a security token, meeting all four prongs of the Howey Test:

- Investment of money (labor/value)
- Common enterprise (Arxos ecosystem)
- Expectation of profit (via dividends)
- Derived from efforts of others (data monetization by Arxos)

### 1.3 Corporate Governance
- **Board Structure**: Minimum 5 directors with 2 independent members
- **Audit Committee**: Financial oversight and compliance monitoring
- **Risk Committee**: Operational and technology risk management
- **Compensation Committee**: Executive and token incentive oversight

---
